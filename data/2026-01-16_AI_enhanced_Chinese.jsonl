We specifically focus on backward reachability analysis, i.e., determining the set of states that can reach a given target set within a certain number of steps. Computing backward reachable sets presents significant challenges due to the non-convexity of max-plus dynamics and the complexity of set complement operations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approximation framework that efficiently computes backward reachable sets by exploiting the structure of tropical polyhedra. Our approach reformulates the problem as a sequence of symbolic operations and approximates non-convex target sets through closure operations on unions of tropical polyhedra. We develop a systematic algorithm that constructs both outer (M-form) and inner (V-form) representations of the resulting sets, incorporating extremal filtering to reduce computational complexity. The proposed method offers a scalable alternative to traditional DBM-based approaches, enabling reliable approximate backward reachability analysis for general target regions in MPLS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity.

We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI.

Deployment of laser terminals enables high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite links (ISLs); however, their limited number, slow acquisition, and instability make forming a stable satellite topology difficult. Existing patterns like +Grid and Motif ignore regional traffic, ground station placement, and constellation geometry. Given sparse population distribution on Earth and the isolation of rural areas, traffic patterns are inherently non-uniform, providing an opportunity to orient inter-satellite links (ISLs) according to these traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose Starfield, a novel demand-aware satellite topology design heuristic algorithm supported by mathematical analysis. We first formulate a vector field on the constellation's shell according to traffic flows and define a corresponding Riemannian metric on the spherical manifold of the shell. The metric, combined with the spatial geometry, is used to assign a distance to each potential ISL, which we then aggregate over all demand flows to generate a heuristic for each satellite's link selection. Inspired by +Grid, each satellite selects the link with the minimum Riemannian heuristic along with its corresponding angular links. To evaluate Starfield, we developed a custom, link-aware, and link-configurable packet-level simulator, comparing it against +Grid and Random topologies. For the Phase 1 Starlink, simulation results show up to a 30% reduction in hop count and a 15% improvement in stretch factor across multiple traffic distributions. Moreover, static Starfield, an inter-orbital link matching modification of Starfield, achieves a 20% improvement in stretch factor under realistic traffic patterns compared to +Grid. Experiments further demonstrate Starfield's robustness under traffic demand perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines.

It is the only known nontrivial (discrete or continuous-time) memoryless channel with a closed-form formula for its optimal non-asymptotic error probability, making it the simplest channel in this sense. A potential application is optical communication with a tunable band rejection filter. Due to its simplicity, we may use it as a basic currency of information that is infinitely divisible, as an alternative to bits which are not infinitely divisible. OCPC with perfect feedback gives a generalization of prefix codes. We also study non-asymptotic coding and channel simulation results for the general OCPC.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These parcellations are defined based on the shape, density, and spatial arrangement of neuronal cell bodies observed in histological imaging. Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using deep learning models toward fully automatic segmentation of cytoarchitectonic areas in large-scale datasets, but performance is mainly constrained by the scarcity of training labels and the variability of staining and imaging conditions. To address these challenges, we propose an interactive cytoarchitectonic parcellation framework that leverages the strong transferability of the DINOv3 vision transformer. Our framework combines (i) multi-layer DINOv3 feature fusion, (ii) a lightweight segmentation decoder, and (iii) real-time user-guided training from sparse scribbles. This design enables rapid human-in-the-loop refinement while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Compared with training an nnU-Net from scratch, transfer learning with DINOv3 yields markedly improved performance. We also show that features extracted by DINOv3 exhibit clear anatomical correspondence and demonstrate the method's practical utility for brain region segmentation using sparse labels. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model-driven interactive segmentation for scalable and efficient cytoarchitectonic mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper explores the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) as a unified solution that leverages its centralized control and network programmability to improve routing, resource management, and security. A mathematical model evaluates the impact of SDN integration on Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), Operational Expenditure (OPEX), and performance metrics. Results demonstrate that SDN-enhanced MANETs and IoT networks offer superior scalability, reduced latency, increased throughput, and lower packet loss, especially in dynamic and large-scale environments. While SDN introduces computational overhead, it significantly enhances routing efficiency, resource optimization, and adaptability. The proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution, enabling the development of network architectures that efficiently manage growing node densities, dynamic topologies, and high data traffic.

HyMGP is compared with HOMER Pro to evaluate its performance in optimizing the sizing of microgrid components, including photovoltaic panels (PVs), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), for remote and off-grid applications. The study focuses on a standalone microgrid in the Saudi Arabia, considering high solar irradiance, limited wind availability, and a constant load profile composed of continuous cathodic protection and daytime cooling. In the simulation environment, comparisons with HOMER solutions demonstrate the advantages of HyMGP, which provides optimal and more flexible solutions by allowing user-defined component specifications and strictly enforcing all constraints. Further analysis shows that incorporating wind turbines reduces the Net Present Cost (NPC) by decreasing the required PV and battery capacities. Increasing battery autonomy leads to a higher NPC in both PV-only and hybrid systems due to the need for larger storage. Finally, lithium iron phosphate (Li-ion LFP) batteries are found to be more cost effective than lead acid, offering lower NPCs due to their longer lifespan, deeper discharge capability, and fewer replacement cycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5e72\u65f1\u5730\u533a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177HyMGP\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eHOMER Pro\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5149\u4f0f\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u8f74\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u548c\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u548c\u79bb\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u7b49\u5e72\u65f1\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u533a\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u98ce\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fde\u7eed\u9634\u6781\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u767d\u5929\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u6052\u5b9a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efaHyMGP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6HOMER Pro\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5149\u4f0f\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u8f74\u98ce\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u548c\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u6c60\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u9502\u94c1\u78f7\u9178\u76d0vs\u94c5\u9178\uff09\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "result": "HyMGP\u76f8\u6bd4HOMER Pro\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u51c0\u73b0\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c0\u73b0\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u9502\u94c1\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u7535\u6c60\u6bd4\u94c5\u9178\u7535\u6c60\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u51c0\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "HyMGP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e72\u65f1\u5730\u533a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7ad9\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u9502\u94c1\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u7535\u6c60\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u94c5\u9178\u7535\u6c60\u3002"}}

Deep learning has shown strong potential in medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-ray interpretation. This study compares two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated pediatric pneumonia detection. Methods: A publicly available dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images was used. Images were preprocessed through normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization. DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights under identical training settings. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and recall. Model explainability was incorporated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to visualize image regions influencing predictions. Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed DenseNet121, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, F1-score of 0.8899, and MCC of 0.6849. DenseNet121 achieved 79.7% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8597, and MCC of 0.5852. Both models demonstrated high recall values above 0.99, indicating strong sensitivity to pneumonia detection. Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations showed consistent focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the reliability of model decisions. Conclusions: EfficientNet-B0 provided a more balanced and computationally efficient performance compared to DenseNet121, making it a strong candidate for clinical deployment.

In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines.

Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance.

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria.

Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Superdirective behavior is achieved by leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling through careful adjustment of the strip dimensions. The antenna features a single driven element, with the other element passively loaded with a reactive impedance. The structure is optimized to maximize left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) realized gain, ensuring high polarization purity and good impedance matching. The optimized design exhibits a 50 $\u03a9$ impedance bandwidth of 3.29 - 4.17 GHz (23.75%) and an axial-ratio bandwidth of 3.43 - 3.57 GHz (4%). At 3.5 GHz, the antenna achieves a peak realized gain of 6.1 dB ($ka \\approx 1.65$), with an axial ratio of 1.4 dB.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

In graph-based replication, the system consists of $K$ files replicated across $N$ servers according to a graph with $N$ vertices and $K$ edges. The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes. An extension of our scheme to the case of multigraphs achieves a higher rate than previous schemes for the complete multi-graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present a control framework that directly incorporates constraints into the control of a voltage-source inverter. We propose a safe trajectory gradient flow controller, which applies the safe gradient flow method to a rolling horizon trajectory optimization problem to ensure that the states remain within a safe set defined by the constraints while directing the trajectory towards an optimal equilibrium point of a nonlinear program. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can drive the outputs of a simulated inverter system to optimal values and maintain state constraints, even when using a limited number of optimization steps per control cycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u8003\u8651\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7535\u538b\u6e90\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u5185\u5e76\u5bfc\u5411\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u7f51\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u7535\u6d41\u5e45\u503c\u7b49\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u65f6\u9650\u5e45\u5668\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6eda\u52a8\u65f6\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u81f3\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5468\u671f\u53ea\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9650\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5Min-Seek\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f\u7f29\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5ef6\u4f38\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMin-Seek\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0d\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u952e\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u8bf1\u5bfc\u601d\u60f3\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u524d\u5bf9\u952e\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u7f29\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "Min-Seek\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ef6\u957f\u601d\u8003\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a unified probabilistic framework to construct L-PIR-SI schemes where the privacy leakage is quantified by a parameter $\\varepsilon$, consistent with differential privacy standards. We characterize the achievable download costs and show that our results generalize several landmark results in the PIR literature: they recover the capacity of PIR-SI when $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, and reduce to the known bounds for leaky-PIR when side information is absent.

By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ViSIL\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u8861\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807(\u5982BLEU\u3001ROUGE)\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u6a21\u6001(\u5982\u6587\u672c\u6bb5\u843d\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5e8f\u5217)\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6458\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931(ViSIL)\u8bc4\u5206\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u88ab\u6458\u8981\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u30022. \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6458\u8981\u30023. \u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1ViSIL\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cVLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u30024. \u57fa\u4e8eViSIL\u8fdb\u884c\u6458\u8981\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "1.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86TuneCLIP\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6539\u8fdbCLIP\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTuneCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6062\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\uff1b(2) \u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5047\u9634\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTuneCLIP\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728SigLIP\uff08ViT-B/16\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cImageNet\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe+2.5%\uff0c\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u6fc0\u70c8\u7684DataComp\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347+1.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "TuneCLIP\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}.

Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u590d\u5236\u6216\u52a0\u5267\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u533b\u7597\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u867d\u7136\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8003\u8651\u504f\u89c1\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u7597\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u53d7\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86'\u516c\u5e73\u6027-\u51c6\u786e\u6027'\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u672a\u53d7\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u504f\u89c1\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u6279\u8bc4\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u867d\u7136\u5728HCI\u9886\u57df\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5b9e\u4f8b\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4ece\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u7b49\u53d7AI\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4e0d\u5e94\u5f53\u4ec5\u4ec5\u7528\u4f5c\u8861\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7684AI\u652f\u6301\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

We analyze the structure of optimal SEFCC constructions through their associated codeword distance matrices and identify distinct FCC classes based on this structure. We then examine the impact of these structural differences on error performance by evaluating representative FCCs over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using both soft-decision and hard-decision decoding.

However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance.

A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks.

Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Code will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "OT-Drive\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u951a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u951a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08SAG\uff09\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9053\u8def\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08OT Fusion\uff09\uff0c\u5c06RGB\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728ORFD OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523095.16% mIoU\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53476.35%\uff1b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523089.79% mIoU\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534713.99%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings.

We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants.

However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object.

Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction.

The channel output is a histogram formed by random sampling of items, followed by noisy item identification. While the capacity of the noiseless frequency-based channel has been previously addressed, the effect of identification noise has not been fully characterized. We present a converse bound on the channel capacity that follows from stochastic degradation and the data processing inequality. We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise.

Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding.

Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory.

We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy.

Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines.

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data.

To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench.

However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts.

Recent algebraic results express the contribution of individual bit-channels to the multiplicities of minimum and near-minimum weight codewords in closed form. In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity. Numerical results for short and moderate lengths on BPSK-AWGN, implemented via Gaussian approximation and closed-form weight contributions, illustrate the trade-off between pure reliability-based and mixed constructions in terms of minimum distance, multiplicity, and union-bound approximations.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples.

However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.\n  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines.

Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \\textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost.

Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods.

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings.

A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets.

Each user requests an arbitrary file from the library. The goal is to design coded caching schemes that simultaneously achieve the maximum sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization. In this paper, we first introduce a unified combinatorial structure, termed the MIMO placement delivery array (MIMO-PDA), which characterizes uncoded placement and one-shot zero-forcing delivery. By analyzing the combinatorial properties of MIMO-PDAs, we derive a sum-DoF upper bound of $\\min\\{KG, Gt+G\\lceil L/G \\rceil\\}$, where $t=KM/N$, which coincides with the optimal DoF characterization in prior work by Tehrani \\emph{et al.}. Based on this upper bound, we present two novel constructions of MIMO-PDAs that achieve the maximum sum-DoF. The first construction achieves linear subpacketization under stringent parameter constraints, while the second achieves ordered exponential subpacketization under substantially milder constraints.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver.

The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\\% of the training data.

Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that \"more context leads to better reasoning\".

However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded.

However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss.

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.", "AI": {"tldr": "DecisionLLM\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u548c\u7ade\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DT\uff09\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u6837\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u6211\u4eec\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u6570\u5b57\uff09\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDecisionLLM\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6b64\u8303\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7f29\u653e\u6cd5\u5219\uff08scaling laws\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7ade\u4ef7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cDecisionLLM\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0cDecisionLLM-3B\u5728Maze2D umaze-v1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DT\uff0969.4\u5206\uff0c\u5728AuctionNet\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eDT 0.085\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "DecisionLLM\u6269\u5c55\u4e86AIGB\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $\u039b$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\\min\\{L+KM/N, K\\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \\textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions.

Based on this generalized framework, we propose a t-design-based coded caching scheme for combinatorial multi-access networks. We characterize a class of design parameters under which every active user has access to a sufficient number of coded subfiles to decode its requested file, and show that appropriate parameter choices allow for the elimination of redundant multicast transmissions. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a family of rate memory trade offs with flexible subpacketization.

The dominant \"retrieve-then-prompt\" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives.

The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only achieves lower transmission load than existing linear subpacketization schemes but also approaches the performance of certain exponential subpacketization schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.\n  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model.

However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Initial Draft of Camera-ready", "summary": "Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval.

Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning.

Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors.

However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making.

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRAG-3DSG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u805a\u5408\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\n2. \u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u8c61\u652f\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff1b\n3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6620\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u7269\u4f53\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728Replica\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAG-3DSG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6620\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG-3DSG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency.

In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $\u0394$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $\u0394$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse. We also characterize the performance of the scheme in the finite field using another converse based on counting arguments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings.

This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded \"lucky guesses,\" leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization)\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Group-Relative Evidence Reward\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc1\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u56e0\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u65e0\u6839\u636e\u7684\u201c\u5e78\u8fd0\u731c\u6d4b\u201d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvidence-Augmented Reasoning\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u662f\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff1bEAPO\u5f15\u5165Group-Relative Evidence Reward\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution\u673a\u5236\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEAPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc1\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5956\u52b1-\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our framework significantly outperforms Berrut-based methods for various non-polynomial functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality.

We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the \"population bias\" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC-GRASP\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u7406\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65e0\u521b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u6027\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u4e0d\u9f50\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7fa4\u4f53\u6807\u51c6\u800c\u975e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1C-GRASP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516b\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5305\u542bZ\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316RSA\u611f\u77e5\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u907f\u514d\u9891\u57df\u6307\u6807\u6c61\u67d3", "result": "\u5728DREAMER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684414\u4e2a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cC-GRASP\u4e0e\u9ad8\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MedGemma3-thinking\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523037.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c69.6%\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316Delta Z\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u5173\u952e\u903b\u8f91\u951a\u70b9", "conclusion": "C-GRASP\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def"}}

In their work, Chandan et al. characterized the expressions for the rate-privacy trade-offs for these classes of WPIR schemes, under the mutual information leakage and maximal leakage metrics. Explicit achievable trade-offs for the same were also presented, which were shown to be competitive or better than prior WPIR schemes. However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Chandan\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08WPIR\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u590d\u5236\u5b58\u50a8\u65e0\u4e32\u901a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u901f\u7387-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MDS\u7f16\u7801\u65e0\u4e32\u901a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548cT-\u4e32\u901a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u5f53\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u7684\u53cd\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "Chandan\u7b49\u4eba\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u4e32\u901a\uff08\u590d\u5236\u548cMDS\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ee5\u53caT-\u4e32\u901a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08WPIR\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u9732\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u901f\u7387-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u4e32\u901a\u590d\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001Banawan-Ulukus\u578bMDS-WPIR\u548cSun-Jafar\u578bT-\u4e32\u901aWPIR\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u901f\u7387-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u5f53\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Chandan\u7b49\u4eba\u62a5\u544a\u7684Sun-Jafar\u578b\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u975e\u4e32\u901a\u590d\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u901f\u7387-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff1b\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MDS-WPIR\u548cT-\u4e32\u901aWPIR\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u5f53\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u7684\u53cd\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3aWPIR\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems.

Success is predicated on at least one decoder recovering the source within a maximum distortion constraint. We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdd\u53cd\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08GR-PCA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56fe\u5e76\u504f\u7f6e\u8f7d\u8377\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u56fe\u76f8\u5e72\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPCA\u5047\u8bbe\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u5404\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e8e\u7403\u5f62\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "GR-PCA\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a1\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u60e9\u7f5a\u5c06\u8f7d\u8377\u5411\u91cf\u504f\u5411\u4f4e\u9891\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u5173\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u76f8\u5e72\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGR-PCA\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u65b9\u5dee\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u652f\u6491\u4e0a\uff1b2\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u4f4e\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\uff1b3\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u5916\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b4\uff09\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5f53\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\uff0cGR-PCA\u76f8\u6bd4PCA\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u5f53\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a5\u8fd1\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6\uff0cPCA\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GR-PCA\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4e14\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Process Reward Learning (PRL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u8584\u5f31\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u5982MCTS\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60(PRL)\uff0c\u5c06\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u52a8\u673a\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a0\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u95f4KL\u6563\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684PRL\u516c\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPRL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u5584\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd(\u7531average @ n\u8861\u91cf)\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8pass @ n\u6307\u6807\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fb9\u754c", "conclusion": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PRL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b"}}

To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments.

Deep neural networks are able to capture rich dependencies in data, offering a powerful means of estimating these probabilities and hence an avenue towards more effective compression algorithms. However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data.

To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features.

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLLMdoctor\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u8bca\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4f4e\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027", "method": "LLMdoctor\u91c7\u7528\u60a3\u8005-\u533b\u751f\u5206\u8bca\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u60a3\u8005LLM\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08TFPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u533b\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010token\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMdoctor\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86DPO\u7b49\u5b8c\u6574\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272", "conclusion": "LLMdoctor\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728token\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861"}}

Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms.

This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics.

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9GPT-5.2\u3001Gemini 3 Pro\u7b497\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdb\u6b65\u662f\u5426\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "GPT-5.2\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4ecd\u663e\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\uff0c\u53d7\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5e27\u65f6\u5e8f\u8367\u5149\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u5f20\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8367\u5149\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6d3b\u4f53\u751f\u7269\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u632f\u8361\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u5e27\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u591a\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u50cf\u5806\u6808\u878d\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76842D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7111\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u4e14\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec6\u80de2D\u5355\u5c42\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u4e2a\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5e27\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8644%\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u591a\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u50cf\u5806\u6808\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf2D\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6210\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8367\u5149\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u6210\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u3002"}}

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoMorph: \u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5916\u56e0\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u53ca\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u6ce2\u5f62\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4e14\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u751f\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "EvoMorph\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6ce2\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aPPG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5fc3\u7387\u3001\u547c\u5438\u7387\u3001\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30EvoMorph\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd1\u90bb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3e\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u8054", "conclusion": "EvoMorph\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u751f\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790"}}

We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models.

Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \\emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \\emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models \"reason\".", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments.

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edftop-k\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7top-k\u68c0\u7d22\u6784\u9020LLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u6db5\u76d6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u548c\u4e09\u7ea7\u5c42\u9762\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce1\u6cab\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u951a\u70b9\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce1\u6cab\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e25\u683ctoken\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u7ae0\u8282\u3001\u884c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u6b21\u8981\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u90fd\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce1\u6cab\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684top-k\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors.

Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "GradESTC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08\u4f4e\u79e9\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u76f8\u90bb\u8f6e\u6b21\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "GradESTC\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c11\u91cf\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ec5\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u6bcf\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u53ea\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65f6\uff0cGradESTC\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u884c\u901a\u4fe139.79%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29FedAvg\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GradESTC\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints.

The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\\% train, 10\\% validation, and 10\\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%.

The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work.

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPG-CBM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9a\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08PG-CBM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u9075\u5faa\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "PG-CBM\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u8d28\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u865a\u5984\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "PG-CBM\u4ee3\u8868\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\u03b2_0 = \u03b2_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An enhanced version was accepted for oral presentation at the AI for Time Series Analysis Workshop at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProbFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\u56de\u5f52\uff08DER\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProbFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\u56de\u5f52\uff08DER\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30DER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u7684LSTM\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e94\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aDER\u3001\u9ad8\u65afNLL\u3001\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03NLL\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cDER\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5-\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86DER\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aDER\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness.

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).", "AI": {"tldr": "Molmo2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u662f\u95ed\u6e90\u7684\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e0d\u516c\u5f00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891/\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e867\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c2\u4e2a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6253\u5305\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u6811\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u89c9token\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684token\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7c7b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7b49\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u738735.5 vs 29.6\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aGemini 3 Pro\u7b49\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u5411F1 38.4 vs 20.0\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u8ddf\u8e2aJ&F 56.2 vs 41.1\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Molmo2\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7279\u522b\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions.

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements.

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available.

Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis.

Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM.

We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\uff08SPS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5c4f\u853d\u90e8\u5206\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\uff08\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u8865\u4e01\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SPS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e27\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u5c4f\u853d\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u8865\u4e01\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5269\u4f59\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f46\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u54ea\u4e9b\u6807\u8bb0\u4fdd\u7559\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSPS\u5728\u6240\u6709OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.2%\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534720.4%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb2.4\u500d\u30029\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u67098\u4e2a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524dSOTA\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u5373\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u6c7d\u8f66\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u7684OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u7248\u672c\u6ede\u540e\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u6ede\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e0b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u672c\u9648\u65e7\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7406\u60f3\u540c\u6b65\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u2014\u2014\u5e26\u586b\u5145\u7684\u65f6\u6ede\u5206\u7ec4\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5047\u8bbe\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u6ede\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u534a\u5f84\u6709\u754c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8f6e\u6b21\u5185\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u52a0\u6743\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u671f\u671b\u8fb9\u754c\uff1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u65f6\u6ede\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u4fe1\u566a\u58f0\u5219\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u968f\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u4e14\u4e0e\u65f6\u57df\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u9879\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7684\u671f\u671b\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u7b97\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6709\u9650\u8f6e\u6b21\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u6ede\u5206\u7ec4\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5.

We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision.

Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS.
