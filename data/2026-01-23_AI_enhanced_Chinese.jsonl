However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MapViT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eVision Transformer\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Vision Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u83b7\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cViT\u5b9e\u73b0\u7248\u672c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a71\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul.

Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \\emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet. The proposed metrics and analytical results provide new insights into the semantics of timeliness in systems where information ultimately serves the purpose of actuation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d7\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u9650\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u5728AoA\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807AoAI\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e26\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u9650\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u6355\u6349\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5728\u5355\u5305\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u5305\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u4f1a\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6216\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5e73\u5747AoA\u548cAoAI\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86Geo/Geo/1\u961f\u5217\u7a33\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f13\u51b2\u65f6\uff0cAoA\u548cAoAI\u4f1a\u5206\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u589e\u52a0\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u9a71\u52a8\u901f\u7387\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u961f\u9996\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5e74\u9f84\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7a33\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AoAI\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Our results show that PPP codes offer substantial performance gains over conventional polar codes, particularly at larger block lengths where hardware limitations restrict straightforward scaling.

In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.\n  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost.

ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods.

GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%.

As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies.

A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization.

However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues.

It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow.

A known way to improve achievable rates for certain asymmetric Pauli channels is to apply a small inner stabilizer code to a few channel uses, decode, and treat the resulting logical noise as an induced Pauli channel; reapplying the hashing argument to this induced channel can beat the baseline hashing bound. We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\\![ n, k ]\\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information. We perform a structured search over small transforms and report instances that improve the baseline hashing bound for a family of Pauli channels with skewed and independent errors studied in prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment.

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08null expert\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c42\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u5206token\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u8def\u7531\u867d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u679c\u6027token\u9009\u62e9MoE\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8def\u7531\u6c60\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08null\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u5f53token\u8def\u7531\u5230null\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u69fd\u4f4d\u4e0d\u6d88\u8017\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8861\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u5305\u62ecnull\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u8bb8\u591a\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606ftoken\u800c\u6587\u672ctoken\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9884\u671fFLOPs\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9token\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u5730\u8def\u7531\u5230null\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8def\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165null\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684token\u9009\u62e9MoE\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep \"academic value\", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet).

However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DuFal\uff08\u53cc\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\u6574\u5408\u9891\u57df\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6311\u6218", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7ec6\u8282", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08HLF-FNO\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8c31\u901a\u9053\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u573a\u89e3\u7801\u7ba1\u9053\u91cd\u5efaCT\u4f53\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u5728LUNA16\u548cToothFairy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDuFal\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "DuFal\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that direct pixel-level learning captures diagnostic patterns beyond handcrafted features and that purpose-built lightweight architectures can outperform large pretrained models for small, domain-specific medical datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408ABCD\u51c6\u5219\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ae\u80a4\u6076\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eABCD\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528HAM10000\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76841000\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8eABCD\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u81ea\u52a8TDS\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001SVM\uff09\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08EfficientNet-B0\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u5c42CNN\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff1bEfficientNet-B0\u56e0\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u5728\u7ecf\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523078.5%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c86.5%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534719\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8d85\u8d8a\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9a\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9ISAC\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u5b6a\u751f\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\uff08ISAC\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u4f18\u5316\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7cbe\u786e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6491\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7ISAC\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u5728ISAC\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u591a\u7ea7\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b6a\u751f\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff08STCM\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTCM\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684ISAC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3aISAC\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b6a\u751f\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8ISAC\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines.

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Results also show that Dynamic Tactile Sensing System was able to locate embedded inclusions and autonomously determine their mechanical properties, useful in applications such as breast tumor characterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u57cb\u5165\u5f0f\u5f02\u7269\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u89e6\u89c9\u6210\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Soft Actor Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u53d6\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u67e5\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u7269\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u5728PDMS\u4f53\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u64cd\u4f5c\u54587.84%\u548c6.87%\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528Tactile Soft Actor Critic\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f6f\u786c\u5f02\u7269\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a2.61%\u548c5.29%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57cb\u5165\u5f02\u7269\u5e76\u81ea\u4e3b\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u8868\u5f81\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57cb\u5165\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u5f02\u7269\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u89e6\u89c9\u6210\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Soft Actor Critic\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u83b7\u53d6\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u67e5\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u7269\u7c97\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u5728Polydimethylsiloxane\uff08PDMS\uff09\u4f53\u6a21\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528Tactile Soft Actor Critic\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f6f\u5f02\u7269\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.61%\uff0c\u5bf9\u786c\u5f02\u7269\u4e3a5.29%\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a7.84%\u548c6.87%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57cb\u5165\u5f02\u7269\u5e76\u81ea\u4e3b\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u57cb\u5165\u5f0f\u5f02\u7269\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u8868\u5f81\u7b49\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions. First, we establish convex-functional generalizations of the strong and weak Madiman and Tetali inequalities for submodular functions. Second, using a special case of the strong Madiman-Tetali inequality, we derive a new Loomis-Whitney-type projection inequality for finite point sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which improves upon the classical Loomis-Whitney bound by incorporating slice-level structural information. Finally, we study an extremal graph theory problem that recovers and extends the previously known results of Sason (2022) and Boucheron et al., employing Shearer's lemma in contrast to the use of Han's inequality in those works.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The task boils down to selecting the optimal number of nodes for a given job. We present a surrogate-assisted multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to automate this complex decision. Our core hypothesis is that surrogate models informed by attention-based embeddings of job telemetry can capture performance dynamics more effectively than standard regression techniques. We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines. Furthermore, our intelligent data sampling strategy drastically reduced training costs while improving the stability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply embedding-informed surrogates in a MOBO framework to the HPC scheduling problem, jointly optimizing for performance and power on production workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Modern datasets contain samples of highly varying quality, and training directly on such heterogeneous data often yields suboptimal models. We propose a dataset-model co-evolution process; at each iteration of our method, the dataset becomes progressively higher quality, and the model improves accordingly.

A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design.

In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information.

These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences.

Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing.

Most existing approaches for code-identification are contingent upon the codes in the family having some special structure, and are often computationally expensive otherwise. Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent. This work presents a new method for code-identification on the binary symmetric channel (BSC), inspired by the framework of subspace codes for operator channels, carefully combining principles of hamming-metric and subspace-metric decoding. We refer to this method as the minimum denoised subspace discrepancy decoder. We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC.

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels.

In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline.

Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

This network employs RISs to reflect ISAC signals into low-altitude space for sensing. To enhance signal strength, we employ active RIS (ARIS) to amplify the signals. Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration.

Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks.

Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay.

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier.

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks.

However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated.

Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring.

Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision.

Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u6279\u8bc4\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8ffd\u6c42\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u884c\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u53164D\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u300e\u89c6\u89c9\u6df7\u6dc6\u300f\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u8bef\u5c06\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e0d\u53d8\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u5931\u6548\u3002\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u8bd5\u9519\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1. \u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u6784\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u300e\u884c\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u300f\u7684\u4e09\u8981\u7d20\uff1a\u7ed3\u6784\u53164D\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1b3. \u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3a\u300e\u8ba4\u77e5\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u300f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u9884\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff1a1. \u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u8131\u8282\uff1b2. \u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6491\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5e94\u7531\u5176\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u5316\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u5e72\u9884\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6062\u590d\u9057\u5fd8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7logits\u7a7a\u95f4hinge\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fdd\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u4ecd\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574f\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u5e94\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6216\u79c1\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u9608\u503c\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5178\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u592a\u5c0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u8d8a\u91cf\u5316\u9608\u503c\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51falogits\u7a7a\u95f4hinge\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u9057\u5fd8\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51falogits\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5dee\u81f3\u5c11\u534a\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u9057\u5fd8\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ecTwitter\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684logits\u7a7a\u95f4hinge\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u91cf\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\u03c0$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5c1a\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65f6\u5c1a\u96f6\u552e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5546\u54c1\u76ee\u5f55\u5b8c\u5584\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u867d\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u65f6\u5c1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\uff08\u5982\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5305\u542bNA\u7c7b\uff09\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eDeepFashion-MultiModal\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u660e\u786e\u5305\u542bNA\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e5d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684VLM\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65d7\u8230\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u8d85\u9ad8\u6548\u7248\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Fashion-CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d89\u53ca5000\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c18\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8664.0%\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eFashion-CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e09\u500d\uff1b\uff082\uff09VLM\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7b2c\u4e09\u5c42\uff1a70.8% F1\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\uff1a34.1% NA-F1\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u662f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u8fd8\u662f\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u533b\u7597AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597AI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u505c\u6b62\u70b9\u786e\u5b9a\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u533b\u7597AI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u79c0\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space.

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u6846\u67b6ARDIS\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u635f\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u503c\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u57fa\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u6f5c\u7801\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f2\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u5e76\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u5197\u4f59\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARDIS\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ARDIS\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u8f6c\u5411\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches.

We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics.

Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.\n  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines.

Ellen Grant", "Davood Karimi"], "title": "Atlas-Assisted Segment Anything Model for Fetal Brain MRI (FeTal-SAM)", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages.

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement.

In this study we perform an empirical analysis of various ensemble-based transfer learning Bayesian optimisation methods and pipeline components. We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance.

Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance.

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well.

We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment.

This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime.

Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark.

However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation.

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE PerCom 2026", "summary": "With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x.

Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification.

Furthermore, a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function, combining Focal Loss with label smoothing, is employed to enhance sensitivity to hard samples and uncertain annotations. Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u751f\u7269\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u5f80\u5f80\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\n2. \u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u914d\n3. \u4f7f\u7528\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08Focal Loss\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff09\n4. \u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5e26\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8282\u5f8b\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u503c\u548cAUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching.

However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows.

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable.

Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art.

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \\texttt{gate\\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u533b\u9662\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u8bbf\u95ee\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793aDeep Gravity\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5dee\u5f02", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u533b\u9662\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5404\u7c7b\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u5e74\u7684SafeGraph\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u548cGoogle Maps\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08Naive Regression\u3001Gradient Boosting\u3001MLPs\u3001Deep Gravity\u3001HGNN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u548cPDP\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "Deep Gravity\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u533b\u9662\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001ICU\u5360\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u58f0\u8a89\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u968f\u51fa\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u597d\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u9891\u6b21\u7684\u533b\u9662\u8bbf\u95ee\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u9662\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u533b\u9662\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u58f0\u8a89\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e"}}

In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.\n  Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65e0\u5fae\u8c033D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u624b\u672f\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e862D\u548c3D\u5173\u8282\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76843D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5f3a\u70c8\u5149\u7167\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u624b\u5957\u5916\u89c2\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5168\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c2D\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f973D\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b6.8\u4e07\u5e27\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u57282D\u5e73\u5747\u5173\u8282\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e31%\uff0c3D\u5e73\u5747\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e76%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u76843D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an \u03a9(p_t, f_c) function.

Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting.

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery.

The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions.

Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to uncover model reasoning, allowing a more extensive analysis of behaviour. We apply XAI to to improve predictive performance of ML models intended for industrial CPS. We analyse the effects of components from time-series data decomposition on model predictions using SHAP values.

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance.

Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning.

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets.

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_\u03c1$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $\u03a9$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $\u03a9$. Given a probability measure $\u03bc$ on $\u03a9$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $\u03c6\\to \\int_\u03a9K(\\cdot,x)\u03c6(x)d\u03bc(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $\u03a9$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $\u03bc$ supported on $\u03a9$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + \u03b5})$ for any $\u03b5> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $\u03bc$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $\u03b5$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(\u03b5^{-d_\u03c1}\\log\\frac{1}\u03b5\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments.

However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis.

In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts.

It has been accepted by IEEE ISBI", "summary": "Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks.

Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erd\u0151s' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis.

However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines.

Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoRo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6062\u590d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u9884\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u53c8\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "MoRo\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eMoCap\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf-\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u59ff\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u63a9\u7801Transformer\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u4f5c", "result": "\u5728EgoBody\u548cRICH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoRo\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5728\u5355\u4e2aH200 GPU\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523070 FPS\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6", "conclusion": "MoRo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42"}}

However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities.

Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark.

In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting.

We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360\u00b0 generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation.

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
