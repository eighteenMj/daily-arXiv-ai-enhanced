However, existing methods often treat heartbeats as homogeneous signals, overlooking the phase-specific characteristics within the cardiac cycle. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Phase-Aware Fusion~(HPAF) framework that explicitly avoids cross-feature entanglement through a three-stage design. In the first stage, Intra-Phase Representation (IPR) independently extracts representations for each cardiac phase, ensuring that phase-specific morphological and variation cues are preserved without interference from other phases. In the second stage, Phase-Grouped Hierarchical Fusion (PGHF) aggregates physiologically related phases in a structured manner, enabling reliable integration of complementary phase information. In the final stage, Global Representation Fusion (GRF) further combines the grouped representations and adaptively balances their contributions to produce a unified and discriminative identity representation. Moreover, considering ECG signals are continuously acquired, multiple heartbeats can be collected for each individual. We propose a Heartbeat-Aware Multi-prototype (HAM) enrollment strategy, which constructs a multi-prototype gallery template set to reduce the impact of heartbeat-specific noise and variability. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HPAF achieves state-of-the-art results in the comparison with other methods under both closed and open-set settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\uff08HPAF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u5fc3\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u539f\u578b\u6ce8\u518c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5fc3\u8df3\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u8d28\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5fc3\u76f8\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fa8\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5fc3\u76f8\u5185\u8868\u793a\uff08IPR\uff09\u72ec\u7acb\u63d0\u53d6\u5404\u5fc3\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u5fc3\u76f8\u5206\u7ec4\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\uff08PGHF\uff09\u6309\u751f\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u805a\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u5fc3\u76f8\uff1b3. \u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5408\uff08GRF\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7ec4\u95f4\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u53e6\u63d0\u51fa\u5fc3\u8df3\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u539f\u578b\uff08HAM\uff09\u6ce8\u518c\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5fc3\u8df3\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHPAF\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u96c6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HPAF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5fc3\u76f8\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5fc3\u8df3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We used multiple explainability and sensitivity analysis approaches to investigate how well models aligned their attention with lesion areas and how this alignment correlated with precision, recall, and F1-score.

While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic.

An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction framework (PnP-MBIR) that integrates a deep convolutional denoiser trained in a 2-stage self-supervised Noise-to-Noise (N2N) scheme. The method alternates between enforcing sinogram-domain data fidelity and applying the learned image-domain denoiser within an optimization, enabling artifact suppression while maintaining anatomical structure. The 2-stage protocol enables fully self-supervised training from noisy data, followed by high-dose fine-tuning, ensuring the denoiser's robustness in the ultra-low-dose regime. Our method enables high-quality reconstructions at $\\sim$70--80\\% lower dose levels, while maintaining diagnostic fidelity comparable to standard full-dose scans. Quantitative evaluations using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features -- including contrast, homogeneity, entropy, and correlation -- confirm that the proposed method yields superior texture consistency and detail preservation over standalone deep learning and supervised PnP baselines. Qualitative and quantitative results on both simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces streaks and structured artifacts while preserving subtle tissue contrast, making it a promising tool for ULDCT reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6 (PnP-MBIR)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e862\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Noise-to-Noise\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e70-80%\u5242\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u6210\u50cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u60a3\u8005\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u901a\u8fc72\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u6848\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u964d\u4f4e70-80%\u5242\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5168\u5242\u91cf\u626b\u63cf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528GLCM\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u76d1\u7763PnP\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6761\u7eb9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u5fae\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8d85\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u91cd\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While previous work has attempted to address this issue by steering the model using guidance mechanisms, or by generating a large pool of candidates and refining them, in this work we take a different direction and aim for diversity in generations via noise optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model. We also analyze the frequency characteristics of the noise and show that alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles can improve both optimization and search.

Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities.

We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes.

The demand for real-time, non-contact physiological measurement has increased significantly, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to support telehealth and remote health monitoring applications. In this work, we propose an attention-based knowledge distillation (KD) framework, termed KDPhys, for extracting rPPG signals from facial video sequences. The proposed method distills global temporal representations from a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher model to a lightweight 2D CNN student model through effective 3D-to-2D feature distillation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of knowledge distillation in the rPPG domain. Furthermore, we introduce a Distortion Loss incorporating Shape and Time (DILATE), which jointly accounts for both morphological and temporal characteristics of rPPG signals. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted on three benchmark datasets. The proposed model achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, using only half the parameters of existing methods while operating 56.67% faster. With just 0.23M parameters, it achieves an 18.15% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, attaining an average MAE of 1.78 bpm across all datasets. Additional experiments under diverse environmental conditions and activity scenarios further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem.

Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence.

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u672a\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u826f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u7fa4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u7fa4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6052\u5b9a\u529f\u7387\u56e0\u6570\u3001\u4f0f\u5b89\u65e0\u529f\u548c\u4f0f\u5b89\u529f\u7387\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7535\u963b\u6027\u548c\u7535\u611f\u6027\u9988\u7ebf\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548cOpal-RT\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u667a\u80fd\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u4eff\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u7fa4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account.

Accommodating this surge and meeting the high capacity demands will necessitate the integration of NonTerrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, the extensive coverage area of satellites, relative to terrestrial receivers, will lead to a high density of users attempting to access the channel at the same time, increasing the collision probability. In turn, the deployment of mega constellations make it possible for ground users to be in visibility of more than one satellite at the same time, enabling receiver diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the impact of multi-receivers in scenarios where IoT nodes share the channel following a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Considering the impairments of satellite channels, we derive a lower bound of system performance, serving as a fast tool for initial evaluation of network behavior. Additionally, we identify the trade-offs inherent to the network design parameters, with a focus on packet loss rate and energy efficiency. Notably, in the visibility of only one extra satellite as receiver yields significant gains in overall system performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, most autonomous vehicle vision systems act as if they are encountering each location for the first time. In this work, we present Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a simple but effective framework to learn spatial priors from historic traversals. The map priors use a binarized hashmap that requires only $32\\text{KB}/\\text{km}^2$, a $20\\times$ reduction compared to the dense storage.

We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing.

Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances.

MAESTRO standardizes MAS configuration and execution through a unified interface, supports integrating both native and third-party MAS via a repository of examples and lightweight adapters, and exports framework-agnostic execution traces together with system-level signals (e.g., latency, cost, and failures). We instantiate MAESTRO with 12 representative MAS spanning popular agentic frameworks and interaction patterns, and conduct controlled experiments across repeated runs, backend models, and tool configurations. Our case studies show that MAS executions can be structurally stable yet temporally variable, leading to substantial run-to-run variance in performance and reliability. We further find that MAS architecture is the dominant driver of resource profiles, reproducibility, and cost-latency-accuracy trade-off, often outweighing changes in backend models or tool settings.

To be published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "summary": "Current parking navigation systems often underestimate total travel time by failing to account for the time spent searching for a parking space, which significantly affects user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u505c\u8f66\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u505c\u8f66\u5bfc\u822a", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u505c\u8f66\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u56e0\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5bfb\u627e\u8f66\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u4f4e\u4f30\u603b\u884c\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u51fa\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u6392\u653e", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u505c\u8f66\u573a\u5c42\u9762\u505c\u8f66\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u6307\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u505c\u8f66\u573a\u6216\u63a2\u7d22\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u505c\u8f66\u573a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u9891\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece7%\u964d\u81f32%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u6982\u7387\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u5927\u8282\u770166%\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6bd4\u76f4\u8fbe\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u4f30\u7b97\u957f123%", "conclusion": "\u6982\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u505c\u8f66\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u505c\u8f66\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u505c\u8f66\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf"}}

In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $\u03c0$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\u03c0$ and $\u03bc$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $\u03c0$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\u03c0$ and $\u03bc$, but only with probability approaching one.

Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning.

The problem is formulated using optimal transport (Wasserstein distance), which provides a principled measure of distributional discrepancy and serves as the basis for the control design. To avoid solving the global optimal transport problem directly, the distribution-matching objective is reformulated into a tractable per-agent decision process, enabling each agent to identify its desired terminal locations using only locally available information. A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication. Convergence guarantees are established, showing cycle-wise improvement of a surrogate transport cost under both linear and nonlinear agent dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves effective and scalable distribution matching while operating fully in a decentralized manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92).

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges.

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics.

Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u5e26\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u904d\u5386\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9MDP\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\uff08\u5982\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u904d\u5386\u6761\u4ef6\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\uff1b2. \u5bf9Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b3. \u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bMDP\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u6781\u9650\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u6b8aQ\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bMDP\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6781\u9650\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the theory on practitioners and provides a dialogue-based hypothetical case study between a stakeholder and an engineer, demonstrating how the theory guides problem framing before designing any prescriptive artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

Preprint, machine learning analysis of 500,000 US traffic accidents", "summary": "This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets.

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u8f93\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wasserstein\u91cd\u5fc3\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u9ad8\u6548\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u5171\u540c\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u76f4\u63a5\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6709\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u5f97\u6c60\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9996\u5148\u5728\u672c\u5730\u6267\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9075\u5b88\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5f97\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684Wasserstein\u91cd\u5fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u91cd\u5fc3\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u5171\u4eab\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases.

We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions.

ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance.

However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks.

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning. We conclude that neural reasoning with explicit model construction is the most reliable among the three methodological categories of neural reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination.

As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries.

While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas.

Under review", "summary": "Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks.

A Methodology for Football with Broader Applications", "comment": "Submitted to Sci (MDPI) for peer review", "summary": "This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems. The paper concludes by outlining future directions toward real-world data integration, predictive simulation, and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability.

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Prior work suggests that models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero undergo sudden mid-trace realizations that lead to accurate outputs, implying an intrinsic capacity for self-correction. Yet, it remains unclear whether such intrinsic shifts in reasoning strategy actually improve performance. Here, we study mid-reasoning shifts and instrument training runs to detect them. Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight. However, their effect varies with model uncertainty. Building on this finding, we show that artificially triggering extrinsic shifts under high entropy reliably improves accuracy. Our results show that mid-reasoning shifts are symptoms of unstable inference behavior rather than an intrinsic mechanism for self-correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-R1-Zero\u88ab\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u201c\u987f\u609f\u201d\u65f6\u523b\uff09\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7a81\u7136\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u5de5\u89e6\u53d1\u5916\u5728\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\u5f88\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u4e0d\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5e76\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u201c\u6a21\u578b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u201d\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u71b5\uff09\u4e0b\u4eba\u5de5\u89e6\u53d1\u5916\u5728\u8f6c\u53d8\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\\% and random selection by 80.1\\%.

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SV-GS\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u63a7\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff09\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0a\u90fd\u5f88\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSV-GS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u7565\u9aa8\u67b6\u56fe\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u540e\u671f\u53ef\u653e\u5bbd\u6b64\u8981\u6c42\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u542b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u9aa8\u67b6\u5173\u8282\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5173\u8282\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d2\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684PSNR\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u5e27\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u521d\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u7531\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SV-GS\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds.

In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.\n  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining.

To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert.

We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior cross-domain generalization performance of OmniVaT on the SDG-VTL task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OmniVaT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9,\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6811\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5355\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniVaT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5d4c\u5165-\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u79bb\u6563\u6811\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6570\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6ce2\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cOmniVaT\u5728SDG-VTL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniVaT\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5d4c\u5165-\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called \"Twin Peaks\". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Additionally, we show qualitative results that highlight the effectiveness and possible use cases in real-world applications.

Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \\emph{multi-user RKHS}.

This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \\texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \\texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \\emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension.

However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u53cc\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u566a\u58f0OR\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4ee5\u8eab\u4f53\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u624b\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u65e0\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u7ebf\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u751f\u5750\u6807\uff1b2)\u6982\u7387\u6027Noisy-OR\u878d\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cc\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3)\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5c06\u56db\u79cd\u9aa8\u67b6\u6a21\u6001\u4e0eRGB\u8868\u793a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728NTU RGB+D 60/120\u3001PKU-MMD\u3001N-UCLA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u624b\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8eab\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, our NeoVerse is built upon a core philosophy that makes the full pipeline scalable to diverse in-the-wild monocular videos. Specifically, NeoVerse features pose-free feed-forward 4D reconstruction, online monocular degradation pattern simulation, and other well-aligned techniques.

Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies.

We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are.

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate.

In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests.

Submitted for journal review", "summary": "Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse.

But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers.

Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations.

To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively. In each iteration, Motion Prediction first predicts where the handle points should move, and then Motion Supervision drags them accordingly. We also propose to dynamically adjust the valid handle points to further improve the performance.

Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts.

To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries.

The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches.

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAvatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u8feb\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u548c\u975e\u8a00\u8bed\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5bcc\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u53cd\u5e94", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u8feb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\uff08\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09 2. \u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e22\u5f03\u7528\u6237\u6761\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea6500ms\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u52a0\u901f6.8\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u572880%\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "Avatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u4e92\u52a8\u611f\u5f3a\u3001\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u865a\u62df\u4eba\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u6c9f\u901a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals.

To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution. Based on MDI, we develop a Modality Dominance-Aware Cross-modal Learning (MDACL) framework that regulates cross-modal optimization.

We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting. To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training.

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data). Through dual-stream distillation, the Student learns to hallucinate semantic community structures from visual features alone. Validated on a multi-center cohort of 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification.

BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position.

In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability.

However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift.

To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines.

Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources.

Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy.

Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating \"average\" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To be published at WVAQ Workshop at WACV", "summary": "In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.
