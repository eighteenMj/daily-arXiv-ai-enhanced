We reinterpret the Fermat equation as an $n$-th moment constraint, constructing a statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}_n$ of generalized normal distributions via the Maximum Entropy Principle. By Chentsov's Theorem, the natural metric is the Fisher information metric ($L^2$); however, the global structure is governed by the $L^n$ moment constraint. This reveals a discrepancy between the local quadratic metric and the global $L^n$ structure. We axiomatically define an \"Information-Geometric Fermat Solution,\" postulating that the lattice structure must maintain \"dual lattice consistency\" under the Legendre transform. We prove the non-existence of such structures for $n \\ge 3$. Through the Poisson Summation Formula and Hausdorff-Young Inequality, we demonstrate that the Fourier transform induces an alteration of the function family ($L^n \\to L^q$, where $1/n + 1/q = 1$), rendering dual lattice consistency analytically impossible.

This paper introduces an operator-based formulation of information theory for imaging. The approach models the imaging chain as a composition of bounded operators acting on functions, and characterises information redistribution using the spectral properties of these operators. Three measures are developed. Operator entropy quantifies how an operator distributes energy across its singular spectrum. Operator information capacity describes the number of modes that remain recoverable above a noise-dependent threshold. An irreversibility index measures the information lost through suppression or elimination of modes and captures the accumulation of information loss under operator composition. The framework applies to linear, nonlinear, and stochastic operators and does not depend on the specific imaging modality. Analytical examples show how attenuation, blur, and sampling affect entropy, capacity, and irreversibility in different ways.

Providing such guarantees is difficult in practice because clock synchronization is inherently imperfect: events generated at different clients within a short time window may carry timestamps that cannot be reliably ordered. Rather than attempting to eliminate synchronization error, we embrace it and establish a probabilistically fair sequencing process. Tommy is a sequencer that uses a statistical model of per-clock synchronization error to compare noisy timestamps probabilistically. Although this enables ordering of two events, the probabilistic comparator is intransitive, making global ordering non-trivial. We address this challenge by mapping the sequencing problem to a classical ranking problem from social choice theory, which offers principled mechanisms for reasoning with intransitive comparisons.

Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem.

However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies.

Yet their quantitative effect on transient energy exchange and subsystem performance is not well characterised. We study a conservative mechanical system with constant skew-symmetric velocity coupling. Its dynamics are integrable and evolve on invariant two-tori, whose projections onto subsystem phase planes provide geometric description of energy exchange. When the ratio of normal-mode frequencies is rational, these projections become closed resonant Lissajous curves, enabling structured analysis of subsystem trajectories. To quantify subsystem behaviour, we introduce the inscribed-radius metric: the radius of the largest origin-centred circle contained in a projected trajectory. This gives a lower bound on attainable subsystem energy and acts as an internal performance measure. We derive resonance conditions and develop an efficient method to compute or certify the inscribed radius without time-domain simulation. Our results show that low-order resonances can strongly restrict energy depletion through phase-locking, whereas high-order resonances recover conservative bounds.

Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations.

It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing strategies face a tradeoff. Aggressive preloading reduces stalls but wastes bandwidth, while conservative strategies save data but increase the risk of playback stalls. This paper presents PromptPream, a computation powered preloading paradigm that breaks this tradeoff by using local computation to reduce bandwidth demand. Instead of transmitting pixel level video chunks, PromptPream sends compact semantic prompts that are decoded into high quality frames using generative models such as Stable Diffusion. We propose three core techniques to enable this paradigm: (1) a gradient based prompt inversion method that compresses frames into small sets of compact token embeddings; (2) a computation aware scheduling strategy that jointly optimizes network and compute resource usage; and (3) a scalable searching algorithm that addresses the enlarged scheduling space introduced by scheduler. Evaluations show that PromptStream reduces both stalls and bandwidth waste by over 31%, and improves Quality of Experience (QoE) by 45%, compared to traditional strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.\n  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture.

Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u5982\u5149\u6d41\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SemanticMoments\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u9636\u77e9\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u504f\u5411\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5982\u5149\u6d41\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8fd0\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SemanticMoments\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\uff08\u5982\u4e00\u9636\u77e9\u3001\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u7b49\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cSemanticMoments\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684RGB\u3001\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u5e8f\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%.

However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge.

EExAPP uses a dual-actor-dual-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture, with dedicated actor-critic pairs targeting energy efficiency and quality-of-service (QoS) compliance. A transformer-based encoder enables scalable handling of variable user equipment (UE) populations by encoding all-UE observations into fixed-dimensional representations. To coordinate the two optimization objectives, a bipartite Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to modulate actor updates based on both critic outputs, enabling adaptive tradeoffs between power savings and QoS. We have implemented EExAPP and deployed it on a real-world 5G O-RAN testbed with live traffic, commercial RU and smartphones.

However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon: even when the actual encoded bitrate does not fully utilize the available bandwidth, stalling events remain frequent. This insufficient bandwidth utilization arises from the intrinsic temporal variations of real-time video encoding, which cause conventional packet-level congestion control algorithms to misestimate available bandwidth. When a high-bitrate frame is suddenly produced, sending at the wrong rate can either trigger packet loss or increase queueing delay, resulting in playback stalls.\n  To address these issues, we present Camel, a novel frame-level congestion control algorithm (CCA) tailored for LLS. Our insight is to use frame-level network feedback to capture the true network capacity, immune to the irregular sending pattern caused by encoding. Camel comprises three key modules: the Bandwidth and Delay Estimator and the Congestion Detector, which jointly determine the average sending rate, and the Bursting Length Controller, which governs the emission pattern to prevent packet loss.\n  We evaluate Camel on both large-scale real-world deployments and controlled simulations. In the real-world platform with 250M users and 2B sessions across 150+ countries, Camel achieves up to a 70.8% increase in 1080P resolution ratio, a 14.4% increase in media bitrate, and up to a 14.1% reduction in stalling ratio. In simulations under undershooting, shallow buffers, and network jitter, Camel outperforms existing congestion control algorithms, with up to 19.8% higher bitrate, 93.0% lower stalling ratio, and 23.9% improvement in bandwidth estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the 3GPP standardization of 5G systems, the 5G Quality of Service (QoS) Identifier (5QI) is defined to characterize the QoS requirements of different traffic requirements. However, it falls short in capturing the diverse latency, capacity, and reliability profiles of NTN environments, particularly when NTNs are used as backhaul. Furthermore, it is difficult to manage individual traffic flows and perform efficient resource allocation and routing when a large number of 5G traffic flows are present in NTN systems. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization framework that enhances QoS handling by introducing an NTN QoS Identifier (NQI) and grouping 5G traffic into NTN slices based on similar requirements. This enables unified resource control and routing for a large number of 5G flows in NTN systems. In this paper, we present the detailed procedure of the proposed framework, which consists of 5QI to NQI mapping, NTN traffic to NTN slice mapping, and slice-level flow and routing optimization.

The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage.

These MDS matrices are very important in cryptography and coding theory because they provide strong data protection and help spread information efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a new type of matrix called a \\emph{consta-$g$-circulant matrix}, which extends the idea of $g$-circulant matrices. These matrices come from a linear transformation defined by the polynomial\n  $\n  h(x) = x^m - \u03bb+ \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} h_i x^i\n  $\n  over $ \\mathbb{F}_q $. We find the upper bound of such matrices exist and give conditions to check when they are invertible. This helps us know when they are MDS matrices.

However, while they offer high sensitivity, contactless sensors necessitate sophisticated design methodologies and thorough experimental validation. In this study, a Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) sensor is employed to monitor the instantaneous currents of a three-phase 400-volt overhead line, and its performance is evaluated against that of a conventional contact-based Hall effect sensor. A mathematical framework is developed to calculate current from the measured magnetic field signals. Furthermore, a MATLAB-based dashboard is implemented to enable real-time visualization of current measurements from both sensors under linear and non-linear load conditions.

Meanwhile, modern planters, sprayers, and Virtual Terminals are already constrained by the bus bandwidth. This paper presents ISO FastLane, a gateway-less dual-stack approach that routes point-to-point ISOBUS traffic over Ethernet while keeping broadcast messages on the existing CAN bus. The solution requires no new state machines, no middleware, and no changes to application layer code: only a simple Layer~3 routing decision and a lightweight peer discovery mechanism called Augmented Address Claim (AACL). Legacy devices continue to operate unmodified and unaware of FastLane traffic. Preliminary tests reported on the paper demonstrate that ISO FastLane accelerates Virtual Terminal object pool uploads by factor of 8 and sustains Task Controller message rates over 100 times beyond the current specification limit. Because ISO FastLane builds entirely on existing J1939 and ISO~11783 conventions, it can be implemented by ISOBUS engineers in a matter of weeks.

In this work, we embrace the idea of looping back to move forward: reusing model parameters through recursive refinement to extract stronger multimodal representations without increasing model size. We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available. Experiments show consistent gains of +3% over standard Transformers and +7% over vanilla recursive baselines, demonstrating that strategic looping is a powerful path toward efficient, deployment-adaptive LMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We model SA as a discrete-state Markov chain and first derive a closed-form expression for the expected time to escape a single linear basin in a one-dimensional landscape. We show that this expression also accurately predicts the behavior of continuous-state searches up to a constant scaling factor, which we analyze empirically and explain via variance matching, demonstrating convergence to a factor of sqrt(3) in certain regimes.\n  We then extend the analysis to a two-basin landscape containing a local and a global optimum, obtaining exact expressions for the expected time to reach the global optimum starting from the local optimum, as a function of basin geometry, neighborhood radius, and temperature.

To appear in Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '26)", "summary": "The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f4f\u9662\u671f\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u5352\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8fde\u7eedPPG\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u5728\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u524d4-6\u5c0f\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9662\u524d\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982PPG\uff09\u5bf9\u5352\u4e2d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u60a3\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u540e\u624d\u5c31\u8bca\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MIMIC-III\u548cMC-MED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4f4f\u9662\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u7ecf\u533b\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u83b7\u5f97334\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5352\u4e2d\u524dPPG\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u53d6PPG\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-1D\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u9884\u6d4b\u5373\u5c06\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5352\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728MIMIC-III\u4e0a\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u524d4\u30015\u30016\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.7956\u30010.8759\u548c0.9406\uff1b\u5728\u672a\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728MC-MED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.9256\u30010.9595\u548c0.9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePPG\u5728\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u88ab\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u8f6c\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e38\u89c4\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u3002"}}

This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \\emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \\emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare.

The FTS-PE is a full-state observer for the pose (position and orientation) and velocities and is obtained through a Lyapunov analysis that shows its stability in finite time and its robustness to bounded measurement noise. Further, this observer is designed directly on the state space, the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions, SE(3), without using local coordinates or (dual) quaternion representations. Therefore, it can estimate arbitrary rigid body motions without encountering singularities or the unwinding phenomenon and be readily applied to autonomous vehicles. A version of this observer that does not need translational velocity measurements and uses only point clouds and angular velocity measurements from rate gyros, is also obtained. It is discretized using the framework of geometric mechanics for numerical and experimental implementations. The numerical simulations compare the FTS-PE with a dual-quaternion extended Kalman filter and our previously developed variational pose estimator (VPE). The experimental results are obtained using point cloud images and rate gyro measurements obtained from a Zed 2i stereo depth camera sensor. These results validate the stability and robustness of the FTS-PE.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b65\u6001\u4e2d\u8db3\u5e95\u538b\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3(COP)\u548c\u8db3\u5c16\u89e6\u5730\u65f6\u95f4(TOI)\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u666e\u901a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u89c1\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u6b65\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u811a\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u63a5\u89e6\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u89c1\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5728\u53f3\u5c0f\u817f\u4f69\u6234RGB-D\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u4eea\u5668\u5316\u978b\u57ab\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4ece\u5e73\u5730\u5230\u4e0a\u697c\u68af\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6b65\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528CNN-RNN\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e6\u5730\u524d250\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u5185\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4bCOP\u548cTOI\u3002", "result": "COP\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u89e6\u5730\u524d150\u3001100\u300150\u6beb\u79d2\u5206\u522b\u4e3a29.42mm\u300126.82mm\u300123.72mm\uff1bTOI\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a21.14\u300120.08\u300117.73\u6beb\u79d2\u3002\u811a\u8dbe\u6446\u52a8\u901f\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cdCOP\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u66f4\u9760\u524d\u7684\u843d\u811a\u70b9\u964d\u4f4eCOP\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cdTOI\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4ee560FPS\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4bCOP\u548cTOI\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u89c1\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets.

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles", "summary": "The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior.

A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLM-UQBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u8584\u5f31\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760VLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6216\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efaVLM-UQBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u6765\u81eaVizWiz\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u542b8\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u30015\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u548c3\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316UQ\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u73b0\u6709UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42VLM\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u5e7b\u89c9\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dUQ\u5206\u6570\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u867d\u7136UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dUQ\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760VLM\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cVLM-UQBench\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While existing surveys provide descriptive overviews of these techniques, systematic analysis of their benefits and trade offs and how such insights can inform principled methodology for designing optimal distributed systems remain limited. This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference.

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology", "summary": "Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u578b\u4e00\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5012\u7f6e\u6469\u64e6\u7279\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9b03\u6bdb\u5143\u4ef6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0eLuGre\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fPDE\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u6469\u64e6\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4e0eLuGre\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u901f\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e00\u7c7b\u4e00\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5012\u7f6e\u6469\u64e6\u7279\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9b03\u6bdb\u5143\u4ef6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u30022. \u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6d41\u53d8\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0eLuGre\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u30023. \u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u5206\u6790\u30024. \u63d0\u51fa\u63cf\u8ff0\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53cc\u66f2\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u30025. \u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0eLuGre\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eLuGre\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6469\u64e6\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5408\u6210\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fPDE\u7248\u672c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff08\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63cf\u8ff0\u6469\u64e6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fPDE\u6269\u5c55\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u6469\u64e6\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \\log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO).

Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties.

However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\\&F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria. Extensive experiments confirm that ORCHID occupies a superior Pareto-dominant position compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring robust convergence and resilient connectivity in mission-critical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability.

Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro.

Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software. SpinCastML reduces experimental waste, accelerates discovery, and democratizes access to advanced modeling, establishing distribution aware inverse design as a new standard for sustainable nanofiber manufacturing across biomedical, filtration, and energy applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty.

For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.\n  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.\n  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5730\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f53\u79efk-d\u6811\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u81f3\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5", "method": "1. \u5c06\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u5212\u5206 2. \u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u8fd1\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u7b7e\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49Voronoi\u5355\u5143\u95ee\u9898 3. \u4f7f\u7528\u4f53\u79efk-d\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u7684\u6700\u8fdc\u533a\u57df\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems. We find that interactions among LELs can fundamentally alter post-disturbance recovery behavior, producing compound disconnection-reconnection dynamics and delayed stabilization that are not captured by uncalibrated load models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\\sim 60\\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model.

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

In addition, the holistic understanding of technical documents depends on the accurate analysis of its particular modalities, such as graphics, tables, diagrams, text, etc. and their associations. In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination.

Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions).

The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters.

The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance.

In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values.

However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG.

Code is available at: https://github.com/zkkli/K-Sort-Eval", "summary": "The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "KSort Eval \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4f17\u5305\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KSort Eval\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6295\u7968\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5305\u542bK\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u6392\u540d\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7(K+1)\u81ea\u7531\u6df7\u6218\u6bd4\u8f83\u83b7\u53d6VLM\u7684\u6392\u540d\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6b63\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5219\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6bcf\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u9884\u671f\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKSort Eval\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eKSort Arena\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6295\u7968\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u523090\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u5c31\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "KSort Eval\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86VLM\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our empirical analysis proves that each one of these tasks requires just an appropriate weighting schema for the W2BGP, while the entire framework remains untouched. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most well-known BO acquisition functions can be easily re-interpreted under the proposed framework and also enable a more computationally efficient way to deal with the computation of the Wasserstein Barycenter, compared with state-of-the-art methods from the Machine Learning literature.

Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity.

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode.

In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off.

Understanding how individual features influence model outcomes is crucial for building interpretable and equitable models. While feature importance metrics for accuracy are well-established, methods for assessing feature contributions to fairness remain underexplored. We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning. Our empirical results reflect the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed metrics for multiple predictive tasks.

The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality.

Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCausalGDP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6210\u5206\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "CausalGDP\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCausalGDP\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0cCausalGDP\u80fd\u591f\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u771f\u6b63\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs.

We introduce a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out these nuisance symmetries to construct a universal embedding space across many models. Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison. Together, these results show that resolving representational similarity at the level of individual stimuli reveals phenomena that cannot be detected by set-level comparison metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, in text retrieval, output (document) magnitude strongly correlates with relevance (Cohen's $d$ up to 1.80), yielding the largest gains on reasoning-intensive tasks. Second, input and output magnitudes serve asymmetric roles: output magnitude directly scales similarity scores while input magnitude modulates training dynamics. Third, magnitude learning benefits asymmetric tasks (text retrieval, RAG) but harms symmetric tasks (STS, text-image alignment).

We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.\n  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents.

We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data.

To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \\geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \\leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification.

Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes.

Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures.

Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Liao", "Chien-Chang Chen", "Hen-Hsen Huang", "Hong-Yuan Mark Liao"], "title": "A Universal Action Space for General Behavior Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets.

To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention.

Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology.

We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning.

Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules.

We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module.

Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an \"emotion-then-AU\" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos.

Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely.

We introduce MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular OD comprising three carefully curated components: OddBench, with 790 datasets containing real-world semantic anomalies; OvrBench, with 856 datasets featuring real-world statistical outliers; and SynBench, with 800 synthetically generated datasets spanning diverse data priors and outlier archetypes. Owing to its scale and diversity, MacrOData enables comprehensive and statistically robust evaluation of tabular OD methods. Our benchmarks further satisfy several key desiderata: We provide standardized train/test splits for all datasets, public/private benchmark partitions with held-out test labels for the latter reserved toward an online leaderboard, and annotate our datasets with semantic metadata. We conduct extensive experiments across all benchmarks, evaluating a broad range of OD methods comprising classical, deep, and foundation models, over diverse hyperparameter configurations. We report detailed empirical findings, practical guidelines, as well as individual performances as references for future research. All benchmarks containing 2,446 datasets combined are open-sourced, along with a publicly accessible leaderboard hosted at https://huggingface.co/MacrOData-CMU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMacrOData\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u7ec4\u51712,446\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5168\u9762\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982AdBench\uff09\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\uff08\u4ec557\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) OddBench\uff08790\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff1b2) OvrBench\uff08856\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff1b3) SynBench\uff08800\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3/\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62c6\u5206\u3001\u516c\u5171/\u79c1\u6709\u5206\u533a\uff08\u540e\u8005\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "MacrOData\u56e0\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u53ca\u5355\u9879\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "MacrOData\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u6240\u67092,446\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u6709\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff08https://huggingface.co/MacrOData-CMU\uff09\u3002"}}

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Pl\u00fccker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis.

The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences.

However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGMark\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684LVLMs\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u62a4\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u65e0\u5173\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u65e0\u5173\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5c3e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u6c34\u5370\uff08AGMark\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u6807\u8bb0\u71b5\uff09\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u6821\u51c6\uff08\u6743\u91cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u6807\u8bb0\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bcd\u6c47\u5212\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660eAGMark\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u540e\u671f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u81f3\u5c1199.36% AUC\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u653b\u51fb\u97e7\u6027\uff08\u81f3\u5c1188.61% AUC\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AGMark\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6c34\u5370\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \\textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \\textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos.

In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS.

In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization.

However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4). The code is freely available.

The design of OE2D algorithm generalizes Falcon~\\citep{simchi2022bypassing} and its linear reward version~\\citep[][Section 4]{xu2020upper} in that it chooses an action distribution that we term ``exploitative F-design'' that simultaneously guarantees low regret and good coverage that trades off exploration and exploitation. Central to our regret analysis is a new complexity measure, the Decision-Offline Estimation Coefficient (DOEC), which we show is bounded in bounded Eluder dimension per-context and smoothed regret settings.

A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.\n  Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations.

However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior.

Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.\n  Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy.

In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global H\u00f6lder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities.

We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\\%$ and $3.8\\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($\u03c1= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity.

However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes.

We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning.

Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets.

Under review", "summary": "High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We demonstrate that, unlike in the image domain where deep generative models frequently assign higher likelihoods to anomalous data, such counterintuitive behavior occurs far less often in tabular settings. We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition.

Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation.

Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks.

This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts.

Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation.

To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture.

Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication.

However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Free-GVC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5e27\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u660e\u663e\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "1. \u5728GOP\u7ea7\u522b\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u6cbf\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u6e10\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\uff1b2. \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u7ebf\u7801\u7387-\u611f\u77e5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\uff1b3. \u5e27\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u7acb\u5e27\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u76f8\u90bb\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u878d\u5408", "result": "\u5728DISTS\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668DCVC-RT\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e93.29%\u7684BD-Rate\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "conclusion": "Free-GVC\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts.

This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions.

The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728MRI\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fde\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790ProtoPNet\u3001EPPNet\u548cProtoPool\u7b49\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u539f\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aEPPNet\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff080.1534\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f7f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u4fe1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u9886\u57df\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay.

This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "MonoSoup\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u5206\u89e3\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u71b5\u57fa\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301ID\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Model Soups\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684ID-OOD\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6355\u83b7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u4f46\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u5fae\u8c03\u7684CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684Qwen\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4f18\u52bf\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MonoSoup\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5355\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301ID\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks.

Anomaly detection in UTS plays an essential role in both data mining and system reliability management. However, existing reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods struggle to capture certain subtle anomalies, particularly small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization.

Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer.

A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026", "summary": "Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes.

While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions.

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or \"mode collapse\", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization.

In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available.

Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned.

However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting.

Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.\n  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faADORA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ADORA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6682\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u6837\u672c\u548c\u52a3\u52bf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u654f\u611f\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "ADORA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture.

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent.

Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms.

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably.

In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN.

While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$\u0394$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video.

Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.\n  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u96f6\u552e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4ef7\u683c\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u552e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u51b3\u7b56\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60c5\u5883\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5305\u542b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4ef7\u683c\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u4ef7\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u6761\u4ef6\u63a9\u853d\u7ed3\u679c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DCMOML\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5185\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ef7\u683c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u6e29\u548c\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cDCMOML\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5185\u751f\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations.

To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement.

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima.

While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling.

Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time.

Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features.

Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e58%\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6982\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u63a7\u6216\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6210\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1) \u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e3b\u5f20\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1RLFR\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3) \u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b4) \u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97", "result": "\u5728Gemma-3-12B-IT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65bd\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u540e\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u6982\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8658%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6848"}}
