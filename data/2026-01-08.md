Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一种基于类型-子类型概念层级的高效概念擦除方法，并通过SuPLoRA技术减少副作用，提升了扩散模型在多概念擦除时的安全性与效率。

Conclusion: 通过层级化概念组织和SuPLoRA技术，该方法实现了对多概念的高效联合擦除，同时保持了模型的整体生成质量，为扩散模型的安全部署提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Method: 采用两阶段设计：第一阶段跨数据集训练平坦照明下的3DGS模型，学习数据集特定的光照编码；第二阶段在小规模OLAT数据集上学习将平坦照明高斯参数映射到基于物理的反射参数。

Result: 该方法能泛化到任意头部模型进行高质量重光照，且仅需单张图像即可拟合未见过的头像。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了对复杂照明采集数据的依赖，实现了仅需普通图像即可创建高质量可重光照数字头像的通用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但往往依赖于表面识别而非深层推理。需要开发更富挑战性的评测来评估模型的复杂视觉理解能力。

Method: 提出Eye-Q基准测试，包含1,343个多语言视觉谜语，要求模型观察概念密集的场景并推断目标单词或短语。采用开放式、人类对齐的评估协议，在轻度协助下探测假设形成和修正过程。

Result: 最先进视觉语言模型在抽象和跨语言谜语上存在显著性能差距，揭示了当前模型在构建和搜索适当概念表示以进行灵活图像到短语推断方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 视觉谜语是评估深层视觉理解的有效工具，现有模型在这类复杂推理任务上仍有明显不足，需要进一步改进概念表示和推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）安全机制在对抗性输入下的脆弱性，提出了一种名为GAMBIT（基于指令陷阱的游戏化对抗多模态突破）的新型多模态越狱框架。该框架通过分解和重组有害的视觉语义，并构建一个游戏化场景来驱动模型探索、重构意图并回答问题，从而成功诱导模型响应恶意查询，显著提高了对推理和非推理MLLMs的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的攻击方法大多仅通过增加修改视觉任务的复杂性来破坏安全机制，而未显式利用模型自身的推理动机，导致在推理模型上的效果明显不如非推理模型。作者提出疑问：如果模型能像人类一样思考，是否能通过影响其认知阶段的决策来主动完成越狱？为验证这一想法，本文旨在开发一种能够有效利用模型推理过程的攻击框架。

Method: 提出了GAMBIT框架：(1) 分解和重组有害视觉语义；(2) 构建一个游戏化场景，使得模型以参与者的角色探索并重构攻击者的意图；(3) 通过结构化推理链提升视觉和文本任务复杂性，使得模型在追求游戏胜利的目标时降低对安全机制的关注，最终回答重构后的恶意查询。

Result: 在流行的推理和非推理MLLMs上进行了广泛实验，结果表明GAMBIT在多种模型上均达到了很高的攻击成功率（ASR）：在Gemini 2.5 Flash上为92.13%，在QvQ-MAX上为91.20%，在GPT-4o上为85.87%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GAMBIT框架通过设计多模态推理激励，利用游戏化场景引导模型主动解决由攻击者重构的恶意查询，从而有效破坏了现有MLLMs的安全对抗措施。这一成果不仅展示了现有安全对齐机制的脆弱性，也为未来开发更为鲁棒的安全对齐方法提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶端到端模型通常在全微调视觉编码器，这可能导致模型过度专门化于训练数据，限制了其对新颖复杂场景的泛化能力。本文质疑这种训练范式的必要性。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive架构：1) 冻结预训练视觉语言模型的视觉编码器权重；2) 使用基于Transformer的多模态融合适配器；3) GRU解码器生成平滑路径点；4) 设计直接优化Rater Feedback Score的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集上的实验表明，冻结编码器方法显著优于全微调模型，特别是在捕捉长尾场景的大型数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 保持强大VLM的广泛知识比深度领域特定适应更有利于实现稳健、可泛化的驾驶性能，这为开发能更好处理真实世界复杂性的视觉模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的SDCD方法，通过引入结构打乱的视觉输入来进行对比解码，有效抑制视觉编码器的纹理偏好偏差，减少大视觉语言模型的对象幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多关注语言先验或高层统计偏差，忽略了视觉编码过程中的内在复杂性。作者发现视觉编码器在弱结构监督下产生的“Bag-of-Patches”行为会导致视觉统计偏差，使模型过度依赖局部纹理特征而非整体几何结构，这是对象幻觉的一个重要因素。

Method: 提出Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD)算法：1) 创建结构打乱的视觉视图（通过打乱图像块顺序）；2) 通过对比正常视图和结构打乱视图的输出分布，惩罚在结构缺失情况下仍保持高置信度的token；3) 无需额外训练，直接通过解码过程校准输出分布。

Result: 实验结果显示SDCD在多个基准测试中显著减少对象幻觉，同时提升了大视觉语言模型的多模态总体能力。

Conclusion: 视觉统计偏差是对象幻觉的重要来源，通过结构打乱的对比解码方法可以有效抑制纹理驱动的偏差，为缓解大视觉语言模型的对象幻觉问题提供了新的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

Conclusion: PCNet通过跨模态增强和物理约束的光学引导实现了鲁棒的热无人机图像超分辨率，有效解决了现有方法的信息损失和伪影问题。

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

Conclusion: 将面部情感作为核心语义锚点而非辅助信息能显著提升手语翻译的忠实度，情感感知融合机制为解决手语翻译中的语义模糊问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc框架通过强调实例和全局层面的空间关系，并采用由粗到精的策略，在跨模态定位任务上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: SiT-Bench作为基础资源，可以推动面向未来视觉-语言模型和具身智能体的空间感知语言模型主干的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

TL;DR: VideoMemory：一个专注于实体的视频生成框架，通过动态记忆库解决多镜头叙事视频中角色、道具和环境的保持一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型能生成高质量短片，但在场景变化或实体经过长时间间隔重新出现时，难以保持实体身份和外貌一致性。这是叙事视频生成的核心挑战。

Method: 提出了VideoMemory框架，基于动态记忆库将叙事规划与视觉生成相结合。系统将剧本分解为镜头，从记忆中检索实体表示，并以检索到的状态为条件合成关键帧和视频。动态记忆库存储明确的视觉和语义描述符，并在每个镜头后更新以反映故事驱动的变化同时保持身份。

Result: 构建了包含54个案例的多镜头一致性基准测试，涵盖角色、道具和背景保持场景。大量实验表明VideoMemory在不同叙事序列中实现了强大的实体级一致性和高感知质量。

Conclusion: VideoMemory通过动态记忆库机制，能够在远距离镜头中保持实体一致性并支持连贯的长篇生成，解决了叙事视频生成中实体保持的关键问题。

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的视频大语言模型后训练方法主要关注整体内容理解任务（如图说和视频问答），缺乏对内在时序一致性和帧间相关性的显式监督，限制了模型捕捉复杂动态和细粒度视觉因果关系的能力。

Method: 1）提出掩码视频预测（MVP）作为新的后训练目标；2）开发可扩展的数据合成流水线，将任意视频语料库转换为MVP训练样本；3）采用带有细粒度奖励函数的组相对策略优化（GRPO）来增强模型对视频上下文和时序属性的理解。

Conclusion: MVP作为一种新颖的后训练目标，通过强调时序逻辑和因果推理，能够更好地增强视频大语言模型对复杂动态和视觉因果关系的理解能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法虽在自动驾驶、扩展现实等领域有重要应用，但通常生成的深度图过于平滑，缺乏精细几何细节，难以实现准确的场景理解。

Method: MDENeRF框架包含三个关键组件：(1) 提供全局结构的初始单目深度估计；(2) 在扰动视点上训练带像素级不确定性的NeRF；(3) 利用贝叶斯融合将噪声的单目深度与NeRF深度进行融合，并从体积渲染过程中推导NeRF不确定性来迭代注入高频细节。

Conclusion: 通过结合单目先验的全局结构和NeRF提取的精细细节，MDENeRF能够有效提升单目深度估计的几何细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Method: 开发了FLNet深度学习架构，利用超分辨率技术将Sentinel-2的10米空间分辨率图像提升至3米分辨率，然后在BFCD-22数据集上进行农作物损失分类

Result: 在Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset上的实验显示，'Full Damage'类别的F1分数从0.83提升到0.89，与商业高分辨率图像的0.89得分接近

Conclusion: 该方法为全国范围内从人工到自动化的高保真度损失评估提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，推动了农业灾害管理的技术革新

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

We introduce HemBLIP, a vision language model designed to generate interpretable, morphology aware descriptions of peripheral blood cells. Using a newly constructed dataset of 14k healthy and leukemic cells paired with expert-derived attribute captions, we adapt a general-purpose VLM via both full fine-tuning and LoRA based parameter efficient training, and benchmark against the biomedical foundation model MedGEMMA. HemBLIP achieves higher caption quality and morphological accuracy, while LoRA adaptation provides further gains with significantly reduced computational cost. These results highlight the promise of vision language models for transparent and scalable hematological diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出FocusUI框架，通过选择性剪裁视觉token降低UI定位任务计算开销，保持位置连续性和定位精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型处理UI截图需大量视觉token，计算成本高且注意力被稀释；而人类交互时通常只关注相关区域。为了实现高效UI定位，需解决去除冗余token和保持位置连续性两大挑战。

Method: FocusUI框架包含：1）构建patch级监督，融合指令条件得分和基于UI图的规则得分来筛选相关视觉token；2）设计PosPad策略，将连续丢弃的视觉token压缩为一个特殊标记以保持位置连续性。

Result: 在4个定位基准测试中超越GUI专用基线；ScreenSpot-Pro基准上性能提升3.7%；仅保留30%视觉token时性能仅下降3.2%，推理速度提升1.44倍，峰值GPU内存降低17%。

Conclusion: FocusUI是一种高效的UI定位框架，通过选择性token剪裁显著降低计算成本，同时保持定位精度，为UI理解任务提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps. Code is available at https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/ResTok.

Conclusion: FUSION是第一个能联合建模身体和手部运动的扩散模型，通过数据整合和优化流程实现了精确的手部运动控制和全身协调，扩展了运动先验的应用范围，代码将开源。

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

Conclusion: REACT成功解决了生成视频中结构失真评估的问题，通过专用奖励模型和配套基准提升了生成视频质量的评估能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Method: 设计自动化流水线从真实视频高效收集偏好对数据，将高质量真实视频作为正样本，通过随机时空掩膜局部破坏并仅使用冻结基础模型恢复掩膜区域来生成负样本；训练时引入区域感知DPO损失，将偏好学习限制在破坏区域以加速收敛。

Conclusion: LocalDPO建立了一个更高效和细粒度的视频生成器对齐范式，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型多模态模型在视频推理中存在严重的文本惯性问题，提出的训练免费推理方法能有效缓解这一问题，提高模型推理的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

Method: 提出ToTMNet架构，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层代替时空注意力。该算子在保持全序列时间感受野的同时仅需线性参数，通过循环嵌入和基于FFT的卷积实现近线性时间应用。架构整合全局Toeplitz算子与局部深度时间卷积分支，形成紧凑的门控时间混合器。

Result: 在UBFC-rPPG数据集上获得1.055 bpm MAE和0.996 Pearson相关性；在合成到真实场景（SCAMPS到UBFC-rPPG）中达到1.582 bpm MAE和0.994 Pearson相关性。消融实验证实门控机制对有效使用全局Toeplitz混合至关重要。

Conclusion: Toeplitz结构的时间混合是rPG中注意力机制的一个实用高效替代方案，虽然仍受限于仅使用两个数据集的限制，但结果显示了其潜力。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes. Code will be available at https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization.

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

Abstract: Resource management is one of the challenges in satellite networks due to their high mobility, wide coverage, long propagation distances, and stringent constraints on energy, communication, and computation resources. Traditional resource allocation approaches rely only on hard and rigid system performance metrics. Meanwhile, incentive mechanisms, which are based on game theory and auction theory, investigate systems from the "economic" perspective in addition to the "system" perspective. Particularly, incentive mechanisms are able to take into account rationality and other behavior of human users into account, which guarantees benefits/utility of all system entities, thereby improving the scalability, adaptability, and fairness in resource allocation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of incentive mechanism design for resource management in satellite networks. The paper covers key issues in the satellite networks, such as communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy and security, and coordination. We conclude with future research directions including learning-based mechanism design for satellite networks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of 5G networks, together with the coexistence of 4G/LTE networks, provides mobile devices a diverse set of candidate cells to connect to. However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.

Abstract: Modern networks carry increasingly diverse and encrypted traffic types that demand classification techniques beyond traditional port-based and payload-based methods. This tutorial provides a practical, end-to-end guide to building machine-learning-based network traffic flow classification systems. We cover the workflow from flow metering and dataset creation, through ground-truth labeling and feature engineering, to leakage-resistant experimental design, model training and evaluation, explainability, and deployment considerations. The tutorial focuses on supervised flow-based classification that remains effective under encryption and provides actionable guidance on algorithm selection, performance metrics, and realistic partitioning strategies, with emphasis on common real-world measurement artifacts and methodological pitfalls. A companion set of five Jupyter notebooks on GitHub implements the data-to-model workflow on real traffic captures, enabling readers to reproduce key steps.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Abstract: We report a case study of four end-to-end attempts to autonomously generate ML research papers using a pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow. Of these four, three attempts failed during implementation or evaluation. One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design. We conclude by discussing four design principles for more robust AI-scientist systems, implications for autonomous scientific discovery, and we release all prompts, artifacts, and outputs at https://github.com/Lossfunk/ai-scientist-artefacts-v1

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于策略比值方差约束的新颖强化学习算法R²VPO，相比传统的硬裁剪方法，在保证训练稳定性的同时更好地保留了高价值样本的梯度信号，并支持离策略数据重用，在数学推理任务上显著提升了性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于策略比例裁剪的on-policy RL方法(如PPO, GRPO)虽然稳定了训练，但硬约束会无差别地截断高回报但高差异动作的梯度，压制复杂推理中罕见的'尤里卡时刻'。同时，一旦数据稍微陈旧，硬裁剪就使其无法使用，导致严重的样本效率低下。

Method: 重新审视策略优化中的信任区域目标，提出通过约束策略比值的方差来提供硬裁剪的原则性平滑松弛。基于此提出了R²VPO (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization)，一个支持稳定on-policy学习并能通过动态重加权陈旧样本实现原则性离策略数据重用的原始-对偶框架。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和openPangu-Embedded系列(1B和7B)上进行了广泛评估，结果显示R²VPO在具有挑战性的数学推理基准上始终实现优异的渐近性能，相比基于裁剪的基线平均相对增益高达17%，同时达到收敛所需的rollout数量减少约50%。

Conclusion: 策略比值方差控制是提高RL-based LLM对齐中稳定性和数据效率的有前景的方向，R²VPO通过原则性的方差约束机制有效解决了硬裁剪方法的根本限制。

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

Motivation: 传统KAN模型在CPU上的推理开销较大，主要因为需要大量样条基函数计算，且难以应用标准量化工具链。本文旨在开发一种高效的查找表编译和量化方法，降低推理延迟。

Method: 提出LUT-KAN方法：将每条边的函数转换为分段查找表，采用affine int8/uint8量化和线性插值；建立明确的推理契约，包括边界约定和越界策略；采用'诚实基准'方法进行速度评估。

Result: 在DoS攻击检测案例中，编译后模型保持分类质量（F1分数下降小于0.0002），CPU推理延迟在NumPy后端降低12倍，Numba后端降低10倍；内存开销约为10倍（L=64时）。

Conclusion: LUT-KAN通过在KAN层中引入查找表编译和量化，显著提升了推理效率，同时保证了模型准确性和可复现性。该方法为KAN模型的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

TL;DR: COMMITTEEAUDIT框架揭示MoE模型中存在跨领域的'常设委员会'专家群，而非预期的领域专业化稀疏路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统假设：探究MoE模型是否真正通过稀疏路由实现领域专业化，而非其他机制。

Method: 使用COMMITTEEAUDIT事后分析框架，在专家群体而非个体层面分析路由行为，在三个代表性模型和MMLU基准上测试。

Result: 发现跨领域的'常设委员会'——紧凑的专家联盟在各类域、各层、各种路由预算下均占主导路由质量；该委员会锚定推理结构与句法，而外围专家处理领域知识。

Conclusion: MoE模型存在强烈集中化计算的结构性偏差，专业化学假设需重新审视；当前均等专家利用率的训练目标可能阻碍自然优化路径，限制了训练效率与性能。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

*Zibo Liu,Muyang Li,Zhe Jiang,Shigang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VNU-Bench 是新闻视频理解领域首个多源跨视频理解基准，包含 429 个新闻组、1405 个视频和 2501 个高质量问题，旨在评估模型处理多源新闻信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻视频理解基准主要关注单视频内部推理，而现实新闻消费本质是多源的——不同媒体对同一事件的报道包含互补细节、不同叙事视角甚至矛盾主张。因此需要模型能够比较多个来源的视角、对齐跨源多模态证据并整合多源信息。

Method: 通过设计新型问题类型来测试模型从多角度理解多源多模态新闻的能力；采用混合人机 QA 生成流程解决跨源新闻理解数据集构建的可扩展性和质量控制问题。

Result: VNU-Bench 数据集包含 429 个新闻组、1405 个视频和 2501 个高质量问题；对闭源和开源多模态模型的综合评估显示，该基准对当前 MLLMs 构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: VNU-Bench 填补了多源跨视频新闻理解评估的空白，揭示了当前 MLLMs 在整合和比较多源新闻信息方面的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中经常需要对文本分类到用户定义的、此前未见过的类别，例如企业分析、内容审核、领域特定信息检索等场景。

Method: 提出软上下文编码器架构：将每个候选标签与标签集和输入查询的静态软提示表示进行上下文化。通过在多样化、多来源的数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在多个未见过的UDTC基准测试中，模型达到最先进性能，始终优于或匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: 软上下文编码器架构能有效解决用户自定义文本分类问题，在零样本设置中对任意领域的未见主题集展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

TL;DR: VeRPO是一个用于代码生成的RL框架，通过基于执行统计动态估计单元测试难度权重，从通过的单元测试权重总和中构建密集奖励，解决了传统二进制通过/失败奖励稀疏性和奖励模型对齐与成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于单元测试执行的功能正确性通过/失败奖励过于稀疏，限制了性能提升；而现有奖励模型存在奖励不对齐和计算成本高的问题。需要一种仅依赖可验证执行反馈就能生成鲁棒密集奖励的方法。

Method: VeRPO通过动态估计每个单元测试的难度权重（基于训练期间执行统计），从通过的单元测试权重总和中导出密集奖励。为加强部分成功与端到端功能正确性的一致性，还将密集信号与全局执行结果集成，建立完全基于可验证执行反馈的鲁棒密集奖励范式。

Result: 在多种基准测试和设置中，VeRPO一致优于基于结果的基线和基于奖励模型的基线，实现了高达+8.83%的pass@1提升，时间成本极低（<0.02%），GPU内存开销为零。

Conclusion: VeRPO通过仅依赖可验证执行反馈构建密集奖励，有效解决了代码生成中RL的奖励稀疏性问题，在性能提升和计算效率方面都表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

Conclusion: 时空LID方法能够有效捕获滑坡监测数据中的复杂时空模式，为滑坡灾害的早期识别提供了更可靠的解决方案，尤其适用于检测同一斜坡不同区域的连续失效情况。

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

Motivation: 现有Tree-of-Thoughts框架中的搜索算法往往忽略语言模型推理的计算成本，特别是在计算预算受限的场景下。研究旨在通过更高效的搜索策略，在有限计算资源下提升LM在问题解决任务中的性能。

Conclusion: LTS在ToT框架中展现了高效性，特别适合延迟敏感和资源受限的应用场景，为有限计算预算下的LM问题解决提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: This monograph introduces a novel approach to polyphonic music generation by addressing the "Missing Middle" problem through structural inductive bias. Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

TL;DR: ReLA利用强化学习进行作业调度，通过结构化的表示学习和聚合来提升调度质量和效率，在不同规模问题上都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实制造系统中的作业调度需要高效分配作业到机器上，现有方案在运行时间和调度质量上存在不足，特别是在问题规模增大时表现受限。

Method: ReLA采用基于强化学习的调度器，通过自注意力、卷积和交叉注意力的模块学习作业操作和机器的多样化表示，在多尺度架构中聚合这些表示来支持强化学习决策。

Result: 在小、中、大规模作业实例实验中，ReLA在大多数测试场景中取得最佳完成时间。在非大型实例上将最优性差距降低13.0%，在大型实例上降低78.6%，平均最优性差距分别降至7.3%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ReLA学习到的表示和聚合方法为强化学习调度提供了强大的决策支持，能够实现快速作业完成和实时决策，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

Motivation: 基础模型决策过程不透明，神经科学和AI领域持续关注是否存在类似'祖母细胞'的神经元（能专门响应单一概念，具有内在可解释性）

Method: 提出两个信息论度量指标：神经元对概念的显著性和选择性；在TabPFN模型上应用这些指标，对神经元-概念对进行简单搜索，找出最显著和最具选择性的配对

Result: 研究发现这类模型中确实存在一些神经元，对高层概念表现出中等但统计显著的显著性和选择性

Conclusion: 可解释的神经元可以自然涌现，在某些情况下无需复杂可解释性技术也能识别这类神经元

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO在复杂推理任务上存在结构限制：序列级优势归一化引入长度偏差、低质量轨迹惩罚被稀释、标量目标丢弃了组内奖励排名中的丰富成对偏好信息，导致昂贵rollout监督利用不足。

Method: 提出了AMIR-GRPO，在GRPO基础上添加直接从组内奖励排名构建的隐式DPO风格对比正则化，无需额外标注。该机制增强对低奖励轨迹的抑制，减轻响应级长度偏差，并将每个rollout组转化为更密集的监督约束。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AMIR-GRPO始终优于强力GRPO基线，产生正确与错误推理链之间更清晰的分离，并在标准GRPO已解决实例之外提供更广泛的覆盖增益。

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO通过利用组内奖励排名中的丰富偏好信息，有效解决了GRPO在推理任务中的结构限制，提升了对昂贵rollout监督的利用效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据驱动反应预测模型的兴起，需要有效的反应描述符来连接真实化学与数字表示。然而，通用的反应级描述符仍然稀缺，这限制了数据驱动的反应分析和发现方法的发展。

Method: 基于RXNGraphormer模型（通过区分真实反应与有错误键变化的虚构反应进行预训练），提取出反应级的RXNEmb描述符。利用该描述符对USPTO-50k数据集进行数据驱动的重新聚类分类，结合降维技术实现反应空间多样性可视化。通过注意力权重分析揭示模型关注的化学关键位点。

Result: RXNEmb描述符产生的分类比基于规则的方法更能反映化学键变化的相似性。该描述符能够有效实现反应空间的多样性可视化，并通过注意力分析提供化学反应机理的深入洞察。

Conclusion: RXNEmb是一个强大且可解释的反应指纹和分析工具，为更加数据驱动的反应分析和发现方法开辟了道路。

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

TL;DR: TreeAdv通过引入树状结构来改进基于分组的强化学习，提高样本效率并减少长度偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的GRPO将每个轨迹视为独立序列，对所有token分配相同的序列级优势，导致样本效率低下和对冗长推理链的长度偏差，且未能提升逻辑深度。

Method: TreeAdv采用基于熵的采样方法构建树状结构组（森林），在高不确定性决策处分支，在低不确定性token处共享；然后通过重新分配完整轨迹（所有叶节点）的优势来聚合内部树段的token级优势。

Result: 在10个数学推理基准测试中，TreeAdv始终优于GRPO和GSPO，且在相同监督、数据和解码预算下使用了更少的生成token。

Conclusion: TreeAdv通过显式的树状结构优势重新分配机制，有效提升了基于分组的强化学习在复杂推理任务上的性能和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

Motivation: 尽管Pivoted Cholesky分解在数值线性代数中的代数性质已被充分研究，但其在核方法中的几何直觉却常被忽视。本文旨在阐明该算法在再生核希尔伯特空间中的几何解释。

Method: 通过理论推导，证明Pivoted Cholesky的列选取步骤在数学上等价于使用核度量的最远点采样，而Cholesky因子构造则是隐式的Gram-Schmidt正交化过程。

Result: 成功建立了Pivoted Cholesky分解在核方法中的几何解释框架，揭示了其与基于核度量的最远点采样的等价性。

Conclusion: 研究工作弥补了理论理解与实践应用之间的鸿沟，通过简明推导和Python实现使核矩阵低秩近似的几何意义更加清晰可操作。

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: R³L提出了一种结合反思重试强化学习的方法，通过语言引导探索、关键信用分配和正信号放大解决LLM强化学习中的探索和利用难题，在多个任务上实现了相对5%到52%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在LLM推理和智能体能力方面存在两大问题：1）探索效率低，困难任务成功率低且从头开始重复执行成本高；2）利用效果差，轨迹级奖励惩罚有效前缀，失败主导的样本淹没少量积极信号，导致优化方向不明确。

Method: R³L包含三个核心组件：1）反射重试的语言引导探索，通过语言反馈诊断错误，从失败点重启，将失败尝试转化为成功轨迹；2）关键信用分配，只更新出现对比信号的分叉后缀，避免惩罚共享前缀；3）正信号放大，对成功轨迹加大权重，确保积极信号主导优化过程。

Result: 在智能体和推理任务上的实验显示，相比基线方法获得了5%到52%的相对性能提升，同时保持了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: R³L通过主动轨迹合成替代随机采样、精细化信用分配和正信号放大机制，有效解决了强化学习在LLM应用中的探索和利用难题，为复杂推理和智能体任务提供了稳定高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

Conclusion: EDCO通过动态优先处理高推理熵样本有效提升领域专家LLM微调效果，为自适应课程学习提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 当前天气预报面临核心问题：许多与决策相关的目标实际上是大气状态变量的函数（如极值、累积量、阈值超过等），而非状态变量本身。用户需要通过后处理估算这些目标，这可能导致次优结果和结构偏差，因为模型并未直接学习这些函数上的分布。

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

Motivation: 当前对基于特定触发模式的后门检测研究较多，但对语义后门的检测关注不足。语义后门由于缺乏清晰可识别的触发模式而更难检测，这在实际应用中可能被恶意服务提供商利用，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

TL;DR: FOREVER是一个基于人类遗忘曲线理论的持续学习框架，通过模型中心的时间概念和自适应回放调度，有效缓解大语言模型的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续学习方法大多依赖固定的基于训练步数的启发式策略，这些策略与模型实际学习进度常常不匹配，因为相同的训练步骤可能导致不同程度的参数变化。受人类遗忘曲线理论启发，作者提出将回放调度与模型内部演化对齐的新思路。

Method: FOREVER框架定义了基于优化器更新幅度的'模型时间'概念，使其与模型内部演化同步而非单纯依赖训练步数。包含三部分：1) 遗忘曲线启发的回放调度器决定何时回放；2) 强度感知的正则化机制自适应控制如何回放；3) 整个框架与模型训练进度保持动态对齐。

Result: 在三个持续学习基准测试上，对0.6B到13B参数规模的大语言模型进行广泛实验，结果表明FOREVER能一致性地有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: FOREVER框架通过引入模型中心的时间概念，使回放调度与模型实际学习进度对齐，为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，在多种模型规模上均表现出优越的抗遗忘性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

Abstract: A subspace code is a nonempty collection of subspaces of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^{n}$. A pair of linear codes is called a linear complementary pair (in short LCP) of codes if their intersection is trivial and the sum of their dimensions equals the dimension of the ambient space. Equivalently, the two codes form an LCP if the direct sum of these two codes is equal to the entire space. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LCPs of subspace codes. We first provide a characterization of subspace codes that form an LCP. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for the existence of an LCP of subspace codes based on a complement function on a subspace code. In addition, we give several constructions of LCPs for subspace codes using various techniques and provide an application to insertion error correction.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enable programmable control of the wireless propagation environment and are key enablers for future networks. Beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) architectures enhance conventional RIS by interconnecting elements through tunable impedance components, offering greater flexibility with higher circuit complexity. However, excessive interconnections between BD-RIS elements require multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB) designs, increasing fabrication difficulty. In this letter, we use graph theory to characterize the BD-RIS architectures that can be realized on double-layer PCBs, denoted as planar-connected RISs. Among the possible planar-connected RISs, we identify the ones with the most degrees of freedom, expected to achieve the best performance under practical constraints.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.

Abstract: A $t$-all-symbol PIR code and a $t$-all-symbol batch code of dimension $k$ consist of $n$ servers storing linear combinations of $k$ linearly independent information symbols with the following recovery property: any symbol stored by a server can be recovered from $t$ pairwise disjoint subsets of servers. In the batch setting, we further require that any multiset of size $t$ of stored symbols can be recovered from $t$ disjoint subsets of servers. This framework unifies and extends several well-known code families, including one-step majority-logic decodable codes, (functional) PIR codes, and (functional) batch codes.
  In this paper, we determine the minimum code length for some small values of $k$ and $t$, characterize structural properties of codes attaining this optimum, and derive bounds that show the trade-offs between length, dimension, minimum distance, and $t$. In addition, we study MDS codes and the simplex code, demonstrating how these classical families fit within our framework, and establish new cases of an open conjecture from \cite{YAAKOBI2020} concerning the minimal $t$ for which the simplex code is a $t$-functional batch code.

This paper introduces $α^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations.
  To reflect modern agentic workflows, $α^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $α^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. Using the off-center reference frame, an inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.

Abstract: In conventional distributed optimization, each agent performs a single local update between two communication rounds with its neighbors to synchronize solutions. Inspired by the success of using multiple local updates in federated learning, incorporating local updates into distributed optimization has recently attracted increasing attention. However, unlike federated learning, where multiple local updates can accelerate learning by improving gradient estimation under mini-batch settings, it remains unclear whether similar benefits hold in distributed optimization when gradients are exact. Moreover, existing theoretical results typically require reducing the step size when multiple local updates are employed, which can entirely offset any potential benefit of these additional local updates and obscure their true impact on convergence. In this paper, we focus on the classic DIGing algorithm and leverage the tight performance bounds provided by Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to show that incorporating local updates can indeed accelerate distributed optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration of such acceleration for a broad class of objective functions. Our analysis further reveals that, under an appropriate step size, performing only two local updates is sufficient to achieve the maximal possible improvement, and that additional local updates provide no further gains. Because more updates increase computational cost, these findings offer practical guidance for efficient implementation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了关键基础设施管理中韧性的量化方法，认为在复杂互依赖系统中，可靠性（不失效概率）已不足以衡量系统健康，需要转向更重视故障响应能力的韧性中心方法，并提出支持韧性决策的量化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键基础设施管理需要从传统的风险可靠性决策转向韧性决策，但韧性目前缺乏稳健量化方法，阻碍了其在现实决策框架中的应用。在高度复杂互依赖的现代系统中，仅关注故障避免的可靠性指标已不适用，需要同时重视故障响应的韧性方法。

Result: 研究建立了韧性量化理解的基础，提出了将韧性纳入决策框架的方法，使韧性能够从定性概念转变为可量化、可操作的决策指标。

Conclusion: 韧性作为系统性能指标在关键基础设施管理中具有重要意义，通过建立稳健的量化定义和决策框架，可以实现从风险可靠性中心决策向韧性决策的转变，更好地应对复杂互依赖系统的管理挑战。

Abstract: Resiliency has garnered attention in the management of critical infrastructure as a metric of system performance, but there are significant roadblocks to its implementation in a realistic decision-making framework. Contrasted to risk and reliability, which have robust quantification approaches and undergird many regulatory approaches to system safety (e.g., "risk-informed decision-making"), resiliency is a diffuse, qualitatively-understood characteristic, often treated differently or distinctly. However, in the emerging context of highly-complex, highly-interdependent critical systems, the idea of reliability (as the probability of non-failure) may not be an appropriate metric of system health. As a result, focus is shifting towards resiliency-centered approaches that value the response to failure as much as the avoidance of failure. Supporting this approach requires a robustly-defined, quantitative understanding of resiliency. In this paper, we explore the foundations of reliability and resiliency engineering, and propose an approach to resiliency-informed decision-making bolstered by a quantitative understanding of resiliency.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) uses highly stable electron beam to produce high-quality X-ray beams with high brightness and low-emittance synchrotron radiation. The traditional algorithm to stabilize the beam applies singular value decomposition (SVD) on the orbit response matrix to remove noise and extract actions. Supervised learning has been studied on NSLS-II storage ring stabilization and other accelerator facilities recently. Several problems, for example, machine status drifting, environment noise, and non-linear accelerator dynamics, remain unresolved in the SVD-based and supervised learning algorithms. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive training framework based on model-based reinforcement learning. This framework consists of two types of optimizations: trajectory optimization attempts to minimize the expected total reward in a differentiable environment, and online model optimization learns non-linear machine dynamics through the agent-environment interaction. Through online training, this framework tracks the internal status drifting in the electron beam ring. Simulation and real in-facility experiments on NSLS-II reveal that our method stabilizes the beam position and minimizes the alignment error, defined as the root mean square (RMS) error between adjusted beam positions and the reference position, down to ~1$μ$m.

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing leverages the intrinsic dynamics of mechanical systems to perform computation through their natural responses to input signals. Here, we study a compliant fiber network inspired by orb-weaving spider webs and investigate how its mechanical design and operating conditions shape its computational capability. Using Cosserat rod-based simulations, we identify how network topology, geometry, actuation, and axial tension impact the nonlinear computation and memory capacity of the network. We further evaluate several readout reduction strategies to assess how computational performance varies with the number and placement of measured outputs. We then experimentally validate these results using a physical fiber-network prototype. Overall, results provide insights and guidance on design, actuation, and sensing choices to enable fiber networks for mechano-intelligent computation. They demonstrate the ability of structured compliant fibers networks to serve as physical reservoirs capable of nonlinear transformation and input-history retention.

Abstract: This paper presents a sub-switching period current-limiting control for a grid-tied inverter to prevent transient overcurrents during grid faults and enable seamless fault ride-through (FRT). Sudden grid-voltage disturbances, such as voltage sags or phase jumps, can induce large transient currents within a switching period, particularly at low switching frequencies. Upon disturbance detection, the proposed method immediately modifies the pulse-width modulation carrier, enabling continuous regulation of the inverter output current within a time much shorter than a switching period without interrupting current flow. The proposed method can be implemented on commonly used digital signal processors without requiring specialized analog or digital circuits or high-speed computing devices. Experimental results from a 2-level, 3-phase inverter switching at 3.6 kHz validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under symmetric and asymmetric voltage sags and phase jumps.

Abstract: Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.

Abstract: Latent Thermal Energy Storages (LTES) can store thermal energy in a narrow temperature range. Therefore, they are favorable for integration into Rankine-based Carnot Batteries. For the design of such systems, simulations based on accurate models are desirable. However, physical phenomena such as natural convection in LTES units cannot be modeled directly in transient system models. Simplified models are required. Therefore, the objective of this work is to derive simplified LTES unit models for use in system models. In transient simulations the state of charge of the LTES influences its temperature profile. The temperature profile depends on the geometry of the LTES unit. Therefore, the geometry must be considered to model the transient behavior of an LTES unit. The LTES unit under investigation has a shell and tube heat exchanger structure. The phase change material (PCM) is located between the hexagonal fins and in the space between the finned tubes. Aluminum fins are used. They have a high thermal conductivity and thus compensate for the low thermal conductivity of the sodium nitrate used as PCM. The interaction between fins and PCM is complex. Therefore, a numerical approach can be used to gain insight into the behavior of the LTES unit. To transfer the results of a complex model to a simplified model where fins and PCM are not considered individually, the effective thermal conductivity of a single finned tube can be used to approximate the performance of the LTES unit. In this study, a model of a section with a single finned tube is developed using the COMSOL software. The effective thermal conductivity of the system is determined by varying the effective thermal conductivity in a simplified model and comparing the results with reference cases based on a complex modeling approach. The results can serve as model input for simplified system models of Carnot Batteries, among others.

Abstract: This work addresses the output consensus problem of constrained heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a switching network with potential communication delay, where outputs are periodic and characterized by a linear exosystem. Since periodic references have more complex dynamics, it is more challenging to track periodic references and achieve consensus on them. In this paper, a model predictive control method incorporating an artificial reference and a modified cost is proposed to track periodic references, which maintains recursive feasibility even when reference switches. Moreover, consensus protocols are proposed to achieve consensus on periodic references in different scenarios, in which global information such as the set of globally admissible references and the global time index are not involved. Theoretical analysis proves that constrained output consensus is asymptotically achieved with the proposed algorithm as the references of each agent converge and agents track their references while maintaining constraint satisfaction. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Although machining chatter can be suppressed by the choice of stable cutting parameters through means of stability lobe diagram (SLD), surface roughness still remains due to the forced vibration, which limits surface quality, especially in the surface finish. Better cutting parameters can be achieved considering surface location error (SLE) together with SLD. This paper proposes an innovative modeling framework of the machining dynamic system that enables efficient computation of the chatter stability and SLE. The framework mainly embodies two techniques, namely semi-discretization method (SDM) and lifting method. The machining dynamics system is mathematically expressed as an angle-varying delay differential equation (DDE). The SDM approximates the angle-varying and delayed terms to ordinary terms using zero-phase interpolations and governs the discrete angle-varying dynamics system. Then, the system is merged over the tooth passing angle using the lifted approach to establish an explicit dynamic system in the compact state-space form. Based on the compact state-space model, the chatter stability and SLE prediction are easily and efficiently conducted. Simulation results show the improved efficiency of the proposed method over other well-known methods.

Abstract: Small-scale wind turbine research in resource-constrained academic settings frequently produces unreliable or unpublishable datasets due to ad-hoc instrumentation, inadequate time synchronization, storage failures, and weak data governance. This paper presents a systematic data acquisition (DAQ) methodology and ESP32-based reference implementation design for field characterization of small wind turbines (100~W--5~kW), emphasizing tropical/coastal deployment constraints typical of Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). We integrate (i)~a student-adapted V-model with requirements traceability, (ii)~hardware selection strategies for high-humidity and salt-spray environments, (iii)~an embedded firmware architecture featuring interrupt-driven rotor speed measurement, state-machine fault handling, and NTP-based time synchronization, (iv)~a local-first hybrid storage design combining SD-card persistence with optional MQTT cloud telemetry, and (v)~a data-management workflow adapting CRISP-DM and FAIR principles with explicit quality dimensions and publication templates. A detailed helical vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) design scenario for coastal Sri Lanka illustrates the complete methodology, targeting $>90\%$ data completeness over six-month campaigns. The methodology is accompanied by open-source firmware, hardware templates, and data-publication workflow artifacts released via GitHub and Zenodo.

To address this issue, we extend the model predictive path integral (MPPI) framework with deterministic sampling and improvements from cross-entropy method (CEM)--MPC, such as iterative optimization, proposing deterministic sampling MPPI (dsMPPI). This combination leverages the exponential weighting of MPPI alongside the efficiency of deterministic samples. Experiments demonstrate that dsMPPI achieves smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Many nonlinear optimal control and optimization problems involve constraints that combine continuous dynamics with discrete logic conditions. Standard approaches typically rely on mixed-integer programming, which introduces scalability challenges and requires specialized solvers. This paper presents an exact reformulation of broad classes of logical constraints as binary-variable-free expressions whose differentiability properties coincide with those of the underlying predicates, enabling their direct integration into nonlinear programming models. Our approach rewrites arbitrary logical propositions into conjunctive normal form, converts them into equivalent max--min constraints, and applies a smoothing procedure that preserves the exact feasible set. The method is evaluated on two benchmark problems, a quadrotor trajectory optimization with obstacle avoidance and a hybrid two-tank system with temporal logic constraints, and is shown to obtain optimal solutions more consistently and efficiently than existing binary variable elimination techniques.

Abstract: A single stage active AC/DC interface able to emulate the optimal load impedance of a Resonant Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester (RPVEH) is proposed. As theoretically shown, unlike an electronic interface that emulates an optimal load generator, an interface that emulates an optimal load impedance does not require adaptation to the acceleration of input vibrations. This allows the use of a very simple control, avoiding the implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms that require lossy microcontrollers. Thus, the proposed interface is equipped with a simple analog controller allowing the RPVEH to work in its Maximum Power Point (MPP) in both steady-state and variable conditions of vibrations, without recurring to multivariable perturbative approaches, as it happens for the most of single stage AC/DC interfaces proposed in the literature. The absence of perturbative techniques allows a significant improvement of both stationary and dynamic performances. Experimental tests of a prototype of the proposed interface confirm the theoretical findings and the predicted behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

Abstract: We propose a maturity-based framework for certifying embodied AI systems through explicit measurement mechanisms. We argue that certifiable embodied AI requires structured assessment frameworks, quantitative scoring mechanisms, and methods for navigating multi-objective trade-offs inherent in trustworthiness evaluation. We demonstrate this approach using uncertainty quantification as an exemplar measurement mechanism and illustrate feasibility through an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) detection case study.

TL;DR: CPGPrompt框架利用LLM将临床实践指南转化为结构化决策树，在三个医疗领域测试中，二分类转诊决策表现优异，但多分类路径分配则存在差异，性能受指南结构影响


<details>

Motivation: 临床实践指南基于证据，但将其整合到AI系统中存在挑战。现有方法如基于规则的系统在可解释性、指南一致性遵循和跨领域适用性方面存在显著局限

Method: 开发CPGPrompt自动提示系统，将叙述性临床指南转化为LLM可处理的结构化决策树。使用LLM动态导航决策树评估患者案例。在头痛、腰痛和前列腺癌三个领域生成合成小插曲，评估二分类转诊决策和多分类路径分配任务

Result: 二分类转诊决策在所有领域均表现优异（F1：0.85-1.00），召回率高（1.00±0.00）。多分类路径分配表现各领域不同：头痛（F1：0.47）、腰痛（F1：0.72）、前列腺癌（F1：0.77）。性能差异反映了各指南的结构特点：头痛指南存在否定处理挑战；腰痛指南需要时序推理；前列腺癌路径得益于可量化的实验室检测，决策更可靠

Conclusion: CPGPrompt能够有效整合临床指南到AI系统，在二分类任务上表现卓越。多分类任务性能受指南结构和领域特定特征影响，表明需要针对不同指南类型优化决策树结构和LLM提示策略

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨大型基础模型(LFMs)在个性化医疗中的局限性，提出LFMs与N-of-1试验的互补关系，并设计了结合两者优势的混合框架来解决AI医疗中的多重悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型基础模型在医疗AI领域展现出强大能力，但其是否能够提供真正个性化的治疗建议仍存疑问。研究发现存在普遍性悖论、隐私-性能悖论、规模-特异性悖论和自动化-同理心悖论等多重矛盾，特别是模型在不同临床研究中表现差异巨大。

Method: 论文提出LFMs与N-of-1试验相结合的混合框架：LFMs利用多模态数据从群体模式中快速生成假设和干预候选方案(含不确定性估计)，随后触发N-of-1试验(交叉自我实验)进行个体层面的因果验证。

Result: 研究论证了LFMs无法替代N-of-1试验，因为LFMs更擅长基于群体模式的预测和假设生成，而N-of-1试验是个人因果推断的金标准。两者互补能更好地实现医疗个性化。

Conclusion: 明确预测与因果推断的边界，并积极应对AI医疗中的各种悖论，对于负责任地将AI整合到个性化医疗中至关重要。LFMs与N-of-1试验的协同作用为解决这些挑战提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

Motivation: 大型推理模型目前自主选择推理策略常产生低效甚至错误的推理路径，现有方法难以控制细粒度策略，因此需要开发能精确控制推理策略的方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器解耦策略纠缠的隐藏状态，提出SAE-Steering两阶段特征识别流程：先通过策略关键词激活特征筛选99%以上特征，再按控制效果排序。

Conclusion: SAE-Steering方法能有效识别和控制大型推理模型的推理策略，显著提升推理任务的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

Motivation: 大型推理模型通过明确的思考步骤取得了显著成功，但这些步骤可能会放大不安全行为。现有防御机制未能充分考虑LRMs特有的推理动态性，因此需要专门针对思考步骤的安全增强方法。

Method: 提出SafeRemind解码时防御方法，利用熵触发器在决策锁定点进行干预，将安全提醒短语动态注入思考步骤，重定向潜在的危害轨迹，无需参数更新。

Result: 在5个LRM模型和6个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SafeRemind在保持核心推理效用的同时，将安全性提升了高达45.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 思考步骤中的安全提醒短语对LRM安全性至关重要，SafeRemind通过动态注入这些短语提供了一种有效且实用的解码时防御方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Conclusion: 研究表明需要开发能促进智能体与世界模型进行校准、战略交互的机制，以构建更可靠的前瞻性认知系统。

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: Image restoration has traditionally required training specialized models on thousands of paired examples per degradation type. We challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that powerful pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models can be efficiently adapted for multiple restoration tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with remarkably few examples. Our approach fine-tunes LoRA adapters on FLUX.1 Kontext, a state-of-the-art 12B parameter flow matching model for image-to-image translation, using only 16-128 paired images per task, guided by simple text prompts that specify the restoration operation. Unlike existing methods that train specialized restoration networks from scratch with thousands of samples, we leverage the rich visual priors already encoded in large-scale pre-trained editing models, dramatically reducing data requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. A single unified LoRA adapter, conditioned on task-specific text prompts, effectively handles multiple degradations including denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze: (i) the impact of training set size on restoration quality, (ii) trade-offs between task-specific versus unified multi-task adapters, (iii) the role of text encoder fine-tuning, and (iv) zero-shot baseline performance. While our method prioritizes perceptual quality over pixel-perfect reconstruction metrics like PSNR/SSIM, our results demonstrate that pre-trained image editing models, when properly adapted, offer a compelling and data-efficient alternative to traditional image restoration approaches, opening new avenues for few-shot, prompt-guided image enhancement.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for predicting chemotherapy response in pediatric brain tumors that are not amenable to complete surgical resection, using pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging combined with clinical information. Our method integrates a state-of-the-art pediatric brain tumor segmentation framework with radiomic feature extraction and clinical data through an ensemble of a Swin UNETR encoder and XGBoost classifier. The segmentation model delineates four tumor subregions enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, cystic component and edema which are used to extract imaging biomarkers and generate predictive features. The Swin UNETR network classifies the response to treatment directly from these segmented MRI scans, while XGBoost predicts response using radiomics and clinical variables including legal sex, ethnicity, race, age at event (in days), molecular subtype, tumor locations, initial surgery status, metastatic status, metastasis location, chemotherapy type, protocol name and chemotherapy agents. The ensemble output provides a non-invasive estimate of chemotherapy response in this historically challenging population characterized by lower progression-free survival. Among compared approaches, our Swin-Ensemble achieved the best performance (precision for non effective cases=0.68, recall for non effective cases=0.85, precision for chemotherapy effective cases=0.64 and overall accuracy=0.69), outperforming Mamba-FeatureFuse, Swin UNETR encoder, and Swin-FeatureFuse models. Our findings suggest that this ensemble framework represents a promising step toward personalized therapy response prediction for pediatric low-grade glioma patients in need of chemotherapy treatment who are not suitable for complete surgical resection, a population with significantly lower progression free survival and for whom chemotherapy remains the primary treatment option.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have become central to computational pathology, aiming to offer general encoders for feature extraction from whole-slide images (WSIs). Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability.
