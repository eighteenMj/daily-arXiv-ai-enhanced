Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems.

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training.

Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SSViT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u6570\u76f8\u673a\u7f20\u7ed5\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u6570\u76f8\u673a\u6062\u590d\u8fdb\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6807\u51c6HDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u6570\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff08SSViT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528token\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u7f20\u7ed5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "SSViT\u80fd\u591f\u4ece8\u4f4d\u7f20\u7ed5\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SSViT\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u901a\u8fc7token\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, this paradigm poses multiple challenges due to the heterogeneity of the devices at the edge of the network, their limited computational, communication, and energy capacities, as well as their different sensing and actuating capabilities. To address these issues, we propose an optimal scheduling approach to minimize the overall latency of a workflow application in an edge-hub-cloud cyber-physical system. We consider multiple edge devices cooperating with a hub device and a cloud server. All devices feature heterogeneous multicore processors and various sensing, actuating, or other specialized capabilities. We present a comprehensive formulation based on continuous-time mixed integer linear programming, encapsulating multiple constraints often overlooked by existing approaches. We conduct a comparative experimental evaluation between our method and a well-established and effective scheduling heuristic, which we enhanced to consider the constraints of the specific problem. The results reveal that our technique outperforms the heuristic, achieving an average latency improvement of 13.54% in a relevant real-world use case, under varied system configurations. In addition, the results demonstrate the scalability of our method under synthetic workflows of varying sizes, attaining a 33.03% average latency decrease compared to the heuristic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6539\u558413.54%\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e33.03%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u4e91\u8303\u5f0f\u867d\u7136\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97/\u901a\u4fe1/\u80fd\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u611f/\u9a71\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4e2a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6838\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5404\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c01\u88c5\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6539\u5584\u8fbe13.54%\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e33.03%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

C", "Srinivas Anumasa", "Dianbo Liu"], "title": "Laplacian Score Sharpening for Mitigating Hallucination in Diffusion Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator.

These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet.

Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.\n  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.\n  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.\n  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.\n  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "RELEAP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347EHR\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "EHR\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u8868\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRELEAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5728\u675c\u514b\u5927\u5b66\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u80ba\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u60e9\u7f5aCox\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "RELEAP\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52AUC\u4ece0.774\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.805\uff0c\u751f\u5b58C\u6307\u6570\u4ece0.718\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.752\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "RELEAP\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u5ba1\u67e5\u5e76\u589e\u5f3aEHR\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Ensuring their correctness before deployment is thus critical for reliability. While prior verification frameworks can efficiently detect bugs for programs running on a single switch, they overlook the common interactive behaviors in distributed settings, thereby missing related bugs that can cause state inconsistencies and system failures. This paper presents Procurator, a verification framework that efficiently captures interactive behaviors in distributed in-network programs. Procurator introduces a formal model combining the actor paradigm with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), translating pipeline execution into reactive, event-driven actors and unifying their interactions as message passing. To support flexible specification of distributed properties, it provides a unified intent language. Additionally, it incorporates a semantic-aware state pruner to reduce verification complexity, thus ensuring system scalability. Evaluation results show that Procurator efficiently uncovers 10 distinct bugs caused by interactive behaviors across five real-world in-network systems. It also reduces verification time by up to 913.2x and memory consumption by up to 1.9x compared to the state-of-the-art verifier.", "AI": {"tldr": "Procurator\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f51\u5185\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u901a\u4fe1\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6267\u5385\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f51\u5185\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c06\u5e94\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u4e5f\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u57df\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef", "method": "Procurator\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u901a\u4fe1\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6267\u5385\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u8bed\u8a00\u7528\u4e8e\u7075\u6d3b\u6307\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u5668\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u6027", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProcurator\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u5185\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u8d77\u768410\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86913.2\u500d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u548c1.9\u500d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017", "conclusion": "Procurator\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f51\u5185\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027"}}

Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5171\u7f6eMIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dDoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684ZZB\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u76ee\u6807RCS\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5feb\u62cd\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MSE\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u3001SNR\u53ca\u53d1\u5c04\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178ZZB\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5feb\u62cd\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Ziv-Zakai\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcMIMO\u96f7\u8fbeDoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5404\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ZZB\u5728\u9a8c\u524d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230CRB\u7684\u9608\u503cSNR\uff0c\u800c\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u4e0d\u540cSNR\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u6bd4Cramer-Rao\u754c\uff0cZZB\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684DoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4eSNR\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism. These results highlight the need for advanced protective mechanisms for language models processing sensitive genomic data, while highlighting fine-tuning as a potential privacy-enhancing technique worth further exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u5fae\u8c03\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728XLNet\u3001GPT-2\u548cBERT\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8ePan\u7b49\u4eba\u5173\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd8\u662f\u524a\u5f31\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528HS3D\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9DNA\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\uff1aXLNet\uff08+19.8%\uff09\u3001GPT-2\uff08+9.8%\uff09\u3001BERT\uff08+7.8%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u5fae\u8c03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role.

Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:027", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets.

This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2dLLMs\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57285\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u540e\u6094\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7b56\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f307\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8be6\u7ec6\u63d0\u793a\u660e\u786e\u51b3\u7b56\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u89c1\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u6311\u6218\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u5174\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u89e3\u4f53\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u8ffd\u6c42\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u7acb\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9632\u6b62\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u540e\u6094\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

We do a rigorous comparison between two approaches. The first is the classic one in which a system identification stage is used to estimate the unknown parameters, which are then used in a state-feedback LQG (SF-LQG) controller design. The second approach is a recently proposed one using a reinforcement learning paradigm called Q-learning. We do the comparison in terms of complexity and accuracy of the resulting controller. We show that the classic approach asymptotically efficient, giving virtually no room for improvement in terms of accuracy. We also propose a novel Q-learning-based method which we show asymptotically achieves the optimal controller design. We complement our proposed method with a numerically efficient algorithmic implementation aiming at making it competitive in terms of computations. Nevertheless, our complexity analysis shows that the classic approach is still numerically more efficient than this Q-learning-based alternative. We then conclude that the classic approach remains being the best choice for addressing the SF-LQG design in the case of unknown parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988LQG\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cQ\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u66f4\u4f18", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988LQG\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52a3", "method": "1\uff09\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1SF-LQG\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff1b2\uff09Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684Q\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6cd5\u518d\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u7684SF-LQG\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9"}}

A Unifying Framework for Fairness, Robustness, and Distribution Shift", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\u03b1$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+\u03b1)/(1-\u03b1)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains.

Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed.

Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u7f3a\u5c11\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u533a\u57df-\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u548c\u591a\u5bf9\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Flickr30K\u548cMS-COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\\em unconstrained} robust MDP.

Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\u03b5^2)$ achieving at most $\u03b5$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length.

A Case Study", "comment": "2 Tables; ML/Big data paper on medical data", "summary": "The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable. We conclude that robust methods, such as Propensity Score Matching, are essential for achieving valid causal inference from administrative data in the absence of randomization", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\uff0c\u82e5\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u75ab\u82d7\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7cbe\u795e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u8c03\u548c\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6bd4\u662f\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u504f\u501a\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4f2a\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u672c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u653e\u5927\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u9879\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u75ab\u82d7\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6096\u8bba\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u501a\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u8c03\u548c\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f7b\u5e95\u5426\u5b9a\u4e86\u539f\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6bd4\uff08HRs\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u590d\u6742\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u5fc5\u987b\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u6216\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u8bc4\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Unlike prior text- or layout-conditioned models, VectorSynth learns dense cross-modal correspondences that align imagery and semantic vector geometry, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits. A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation.

LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

Moreover, discrete time implementation of the algorithm does not necessarily guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories when sudden changes in the perturbation occur in between two time samples.

However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories.

Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%. This elegant nonlinear-dynamics-based approach establishes a unified theory including modelling and analysis for the RDPS transient dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6447\u6446\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7b49\u9762\u79ef\u5224\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u573a\u7ad9\u6682\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4ece\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u5411\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9769\u547d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u6682\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u80fd\u6216\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u4f4e\u7535\u538b\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6682\u6001\u5207\u6362\u673a\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u6447\u6446\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u6548\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7b49\u9762\u79ef\u5224\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u573a\u7ad9\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u5207\u9664\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7ea61%\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6682\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6682\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

To overcome this challenge, online and adaptive methods have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we consider the class of discrete-time linear systems with unknown time-varying parameters. We propose a simple, modular, and computationally tractable approach by combining two classical and well-known building blocks from estimation and control: the least mean square filter and the certainty-equivalent linear quadratic regulator.

Contrary to this view, this paper reveals that beneath the random surface of noise lies strong analyzable patterns. Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step \"Semantic Erasure-Injection\" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model.

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362(PAR)\u7684SPaCQL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u504f\u79bb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6307\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PAR\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3OOD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PAR\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u504f\u79bb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5448\u6307\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSPaCQL\u5728\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPaCQL\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebfMARL\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH).

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

However, encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains. To address this issue, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Decoupled Network (DCDNet). In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information.

When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents.

Conventional approaches include the ideal transformer method (ITM) and its impedance-based variants, which trade accuracy for stability, as well as some $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control-based approaches, which do not make use of all the available information in their optimization for accuracy. Designing for transparency, as opposed to accuracy as existing approaches do, would achieve both accuracy and stability, while making use of all the dynamical information present in the idealized interconnection of the grid and device. The approach proposed in this paper employs model matching to formulate the PHIL problem as an $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control problem using transparency as the explicit frequency-domain control objective.

Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets.

The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u77ed\u8def\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u76f8\u95f4\u77ed\u8def\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u653e\u7535\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6545\u969c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u963b\u6b62\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u70ed\u5e94\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u529f\u7387\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672a\u80fd\u9884\u9632\u77ed\u8def\u6545\u969c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fde\u9501\u6545\u969c\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\u635f\u574f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u77ed\u8def\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u76f8\u95f4\u77ed\u8def\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6545\u969c\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7247\u4e0a\u4e3b\u52a8\u77ed\u8def\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9694\u79bb\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6545\u969c\u6269\u6563\uff1b\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684\u70ed\u5e94\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6545\u969c\u4e2d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u8fd0\u884c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002"}}

DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PC-Diffusion \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 DPO \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u73b0\u6709 DPO \u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "PC-Diffusion \u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e DPO \u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "PC-Diffusion \u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features.

This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets.

The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence.

However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline.

This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes.

Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench.

Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain.

To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eSDE\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6TimeFlow\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfODE\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSDE\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6TimeFlow\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6765\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u968f\u673a\u9879\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTimeFlow\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "SDE-based\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6TimeFlow\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "MonoCLUE\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u76ee3D\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728KITTI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u76ee3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u91ce\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6216\u622a\u65ad\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884cK-means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7269\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5355\u76ee3D\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728KITTI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8003\u8651\u8f66\u8f86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u914d\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.44%\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u8003\u8651\u884c\u7a0b\u9009\u62e9\u7684MIP\u6a21\u578b\uff0819.6%\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u5458\u89c4\u6a21\u83b7\u5f973%-10%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662fMIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eConformal Prediction\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfHJ\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Conformal Prediction\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6807\u79f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5230\u8fbe\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001", "conclusion": "CP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u53ef\u9760"}}

Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\"\u5355\u4efb\u52a1-\u5355\u6a21\u578b\"\u8303\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8fc7\u7a0b\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u4ee4\u724c\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To appear in AAAI 2026", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning.

Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7b14\u753b\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u951a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7ed8\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u751f\u6210\u524d\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u7b14\u753b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u968f\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u7b14\u753b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7b14\u753b\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u8981\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u7b14\u753b\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u753b\u5e03\u4e0a\u951a\u5b9a\u7b14\u753b\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed8\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5df2\u751f\u6210\u7b14\u753b\u53ca\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7b14\u753b\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u7075\u6d3b\u64cd\u63a7\u7b14\u753b\u7ea7\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u7b14\u753b\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HardFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u7ec8\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u8def\u5f84\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u7ec8\u7aef\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u4e0d\u9650\u5236\u6574\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u79ef\u5206\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7ec8\u7aef\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fb9\u754c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eHardFlow\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient.

To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets.

Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a \"detect-and-refine\" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHD\u00b2-SSC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6807\u6ce8-\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u57282D\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e3D\u8f93\u51fa\u95f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u95f4\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "1. \u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u6cbf\u4f2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u906e\u6321\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u7c97\u50cf\u7d20\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\"\u68c0\u6d4b-\u4f18\u5316\"\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u4f53\u7d20\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u4f53\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cSSCBench-KITTI-360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HD\u00b2-SSC\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SSC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability.

The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment.

Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TLDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u6587\u6863\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6587\u6863\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u548c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5e76\u884cLDA\u65b9\u6cd53-4\u500d\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u8fc710\u4ebf\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e#MeToo\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u9009\u4e3e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "TLDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u56de\u7b54\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Code is available at https://github.com/AIPMLab/FedMedCLIP", "summary": "Despite the remarkable performance of deep models in medical imaging, they still require source data for training, which limits their potential in light of privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\\times$ faster than FedAVG).", "AI": {"tldr": "FedMedCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KL\u6563\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5FedMedCLIP\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63a9\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5757\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63a9\u7801MLP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KL\u6563\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5728ISIC2019\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad88%\uff09\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u6bd4FedAVG\u5feb120\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FedMedCLIP\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration.

Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Murphy\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8f6e\u53cd\u601d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u7b49\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "Murphy\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen\u548cOLMo\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMurphy\u76f8\u6bd4GRPO\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe8%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9pass@1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Murphy\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u53cd\u601d\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffRegCD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u5bc6\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ecf\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u5dee\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u548c\u5730\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiffRegCD\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \\emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \\emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0eLLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5PrimeKGQA\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u957f\u94fe\u6761\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5bfc\u5411\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\u548c\u526a\u679d\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u94fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PrimeKGQA\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002"}}

Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM). Accepted Manuscript version uploaded", "summary": "Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function.

Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization.

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e94\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u914d\u7f6e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u5f85\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e94\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7406\u5185\u5d4c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ba1\u614e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks.

While recent vision-language models achieve strong results in general radiology report generation, they often fail to adequately describe rare but clinically important pathologies like fractures.

After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $\u03c0$-noise generators. We validate Rectified Noise by conducting extensive experiments across various model architectures on different datasets.

However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76XAI\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6ce8\u5851\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u51cf\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5c0619\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u51cf\u5c11\u52309\u62166\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5e94\u7528SHAP\u3001Grad-CAM\u548cLIME\u5206\u6790\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c0619\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u51cf\u5c11\u52309\u4e2a\u548c6\u4e2a", "result": "\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions.

By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision.

However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6ce8\u5851\u6210\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u5f25\u8865\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u6709LSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Traditional weed management methods, primarily relying on chemical herbicides, risk environmental contamination and lead to the emergence of herbicide-resistant species. Precision weeding, leveraging computer vision and machine learning methods, offers a promising eco-friendly alternative but is often limited by reliance on high-power computational platforms. This work presents an optimized, low-power edge AI system for weeds detection based on the YOLOv8n object detector deployed on the STM32U575ZI microcontroller. Several compression techniques are applied to the detection model, including structured pruning, integer quantization and input image resolution scaling in order to meet strict hardware constraints. The model is trained and evaluated on the CropAndWeed dataset with 74 plant species, achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and efficiency.

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV.

SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task.

We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space.

Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations.

However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u79f0\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6a21\u4eff\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u504f\u79fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4ece\u6807\u79f0\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels.

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error.

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments.

While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner.

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions.

Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors.

Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60(R-DFL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u987a\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60(S-DFL)\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u62a5\u7ae5\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cR-DFL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "R-DFL\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success.

A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues.

Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored.

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u8303\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u672f\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8be5\u56e0\u5b50\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality.

To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors.

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.\n  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model.

However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP.

Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency.

To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions.

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u907f\u514d\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6613\u4e8e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u907f\u514d\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60(MIL)\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u907f\u514d\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80dc\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL.

This work is part of the Zerovision project. Code available at: https://github.com/ertis-research/zerovision", "summary": "Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cSegment Anything Model 2(SAM2)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u6ce1\u6cab\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce1\u6cab\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u7684\u6ce1\u6cab\u5f62\u6210\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5171\u4eab\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u500b\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u4e4b\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u96c6\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Flower\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u5fae\u8c03SAM2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e2d\u592eFog\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ec5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3\u8fbe\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6ce1\u6cab\u6570\u636e\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce1\u6cab\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales.

We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL.

To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm.

However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance.

While recent diffusion-based methods have outperformed GAN-based approaches, existing techniques, such as the diffusion-based relighting framework IC-Light, still fall short in producing shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially in composite images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking.

Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes.

Accepted for publication at AAAI 2026 (40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)", "summary": "Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u5927\u5316\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Best-of-N\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "Best-of-N\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u4ecd\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u91cd\u8ff0\u76f8\u540c\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u65b9\u5dee", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u6b65\u70b9\u5904\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u9884\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u96c6\u603b\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ece\u66fc\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image.

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error.

The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy. Notably, our method proves effective on a wide range of models, in contrast to prior work, demonstrating a robust and potent approach to compromising the fairness of machine learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7834\u574f\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u84c4\u610f\u7834\u574f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6295\u6bd2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5730\u635f\u5bb3\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u4ee5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u7a0d\u5dee\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u9632\u8303\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding.

We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LPPG-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168RL\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u73b0\u6709LMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Dykstra\u6295\u5f71\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22\u907f\u514d\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u5bfc\u822a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLPPG-RL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u7eedLMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "LPPG-RL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684LMORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a method that improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency by adaptively modulating the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u66f2\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u8ddd\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95f4\u8ddd\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation.

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08PINO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684PDE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548cPINNs\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPDE\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cPINNs\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08PINO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u6eda\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "PINO\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8fa8\u738710\u500d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "PINO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel \"decompose-editingfusion\" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\\times$ less condensation time.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImageBindDC\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728ImageBind\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u7cbe\u786e\u65e0\u9650\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5f88\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728ImageBind\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570(CF)\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYU-v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b5\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.2%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e864\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "ImageBindDC\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite its importance, prior approaches largely rely on empirical heuristics and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \\emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.\n  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \\emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \\emph{direct} and \\emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.\n  Furthermore, we establish a general \\emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure.

However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow.

However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning.

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5728\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5149\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0eSFT\u5728\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aRLVR\u770b\u4f3c\u7a00\u758f\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9610\u660eRL\u4e0eSFT\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u95f8\u95e8\u7406\u8bba\uff1a\u95f8\u95e8I\uff08KL\u951a\u5b9a\uff09\u65bd\u52a0KL\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u95f8\u95e8II\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u5411\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u95f8\u95e8III\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u9690\u85cf\u975e\u504f\u597d\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5fae\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5149\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u83b7\u5f97\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u800cSFT\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5149\u8c31\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982RLVR\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u4e0eSFT\u5904\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528SFT-era\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9RLVR\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5957\u7528SFT-era\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11AI\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u8fb9\u9645\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u9879\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u7126\u70b9\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8fde\u7eed\u7248\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e4b\u524d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4f1a\u7f29\u51cf\u539f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51b2\u7a81\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u8fb9\u9645\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u9879\u6765\u6269\u5927\u539f\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0e\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fb9\u9645\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u6765\u6e90\u7126\u70b9\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u65b0\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u9645\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.\n  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment.

However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods.

The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline.

While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns.

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9RoPE\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mixed RoPE\u548cSpherical RoPE\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "RoPE\u5728NLP\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u6210\u529f\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpherical RoPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff0c\u4e0e\u8981\u6c42\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684Mixed RoPE\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0Spherical RoPE\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u7b49\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u901a\u5e38\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a81\u7834\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5fc5\u987b\u76f8\u5bf9\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anatomy-VLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u53d7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u522b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Anatomy-VLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling \"what is generated\" (content-specific flaws) from \"how it is generated\" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OmniAID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u7684MoE\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Mirage\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4bAIGI\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fc7\u65f6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u8def\u7531\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u901a\u7528\u4f2a\u9020\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u548cMirage\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniAID\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026"}}

An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning.

Website: https://univa.online/", "summary": "While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7a81\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "method": "SENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "SENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u764c\u75c7\u8010\u836f\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u7f16\u8f913D\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684NeRF\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6807\u51c63D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c13D\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Ventriculomegaly is a prenatal condition characterized by dilated cerebral ventricles of the fetal brain and is important to diagnose early, as it can be associated with an increased risk for fetal aneuploidies and/or underlying genetic syndromes. An Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), recently developed by our group, was fine-tuned for a binary classification task to distinguish fetal brain ultrasound images as either normal or showing ventriculomegaly. The USF-MAE incorporates a Vision Transformer encoder pretrained on more than 370,000 ultrasound images from the OpenUS-46 corpus. For this study, the pretrained encoder was adapted and fine-tuned on a curated dataset of fetal brain ultrasound images to optimize its performance for ventriculomegaly detection. Model evaluation was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation and an independent test cohort, and performance was quantified using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed USF-MAE model reached an F1-score of 91.76% on the 5-fold cross-validation and 91.78% on the independent test set, with much higher scores than those obtained by the baseline models by 19.37% and 16.15% compared to VGG-19, 2.31% and 2.56% compared to ResNet-50, and 5.03% and 11.93% compared to ViT-B/16, respectively. The model also showed a high mean test precision of 94.47% and an accuracy of 97.24%.
