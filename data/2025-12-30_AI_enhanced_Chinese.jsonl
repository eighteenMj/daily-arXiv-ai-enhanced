Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Transformerbased models have demonstrated strong performance, their computational cost scales poorly with the number of users. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid Tree-Transformer architecture that achieves scalable per-user power allocation. Our model compresses user features via a binary tree into a global root representation, applies a Transformer encoder solely to this root, and decodes per-user uplink and downlink powers through a shared decoder. This design achieves logarithmic depth and linear total complexity, enabling efficient inference across large and variable user sets without retraining or architectural changes. We evaluate our model on the max-min fairness problem in cellfree massive MIMO systems and demonstrate that it achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing inference time compared to full-attention baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the SDRE technique, we solve the State-Dependent Riccati Equation to determine the control for regulating a nonlinear input-affine system. Since an analytic solution to SDRE is not straightforward, one method is to linearize the system at every state, solve the corresponding Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE), and apply optimal control until the next state of the system. Completing this task with high frequency gives a result like the original SDRE technique. Both approaches require a complete model; therefore, here we propose a method that solves ARE in every state of the system using a partially model-free approach that learns optimal control in every state of the system, without explicit knowledge of the drift dynamics, based on Integral Reinforcement Learning (IRL). To show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we apply it to the second-order nonlinear system in simulation and compare its performance with the classical SDRE method, which relies on the system's model and solves the ARE at each state. Our simulation results demonstrate that, with sufficient iterations, the IRL-based approach achieves approximately the same performance as the conventional SDRE method, demonstrating its capability as a reliable alternative for nonlinear system control that does not require an explicit environmental model.

Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p<0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p<0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC>0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86MRI\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "MRI\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff081.5T vs 3.0T\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u573a\u5f3a\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e73\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u3001\u80f0\u817a\u3001\u9888\u690e\uff09\u6309\u7167\u573a\u5f3a\uff081.5T vs 3.0T\uff09\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ennU-Net\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4ec5\u75281.5T\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08m-1.5T\uff09\u3001\u4ec5\u75283.0T\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08m-3.0T\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08m-combined\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u573a\u5f3a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7UMAP\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5305\u62ec23\u4e2a\u4e00\u9636\u53ca\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\uff0cm-3.0T\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff08p<0.0001\uff09\u3002\u80f0\u817a\u5206\u5272\u663e\u793a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0cm-3.0T\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u7684DSC\u503c\uff0c\u800cm-1.5T\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9888\u690e\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u573a\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8de8\u573a\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6240\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684DSC>0.92\uff09\u3002\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u5ea6\u573a\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff08silhouette\u5206\u65700.23-0.29\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9aa8\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\uff080.12\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5c0f\u75c5\u7076\uff09\u3002MRI\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u52a0\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

To ensure network scalability, user-centric clustering (UCC) has emerged as a practical approach, wherein only a selected subset of preferred APs jointly serves each UE. Forming the optimal cluster of APs for each UE is a challenging task, particularly when limited fronthaul and processing capabilities of both APs and UEs are considered. This challenge is exacerbated by the need for dynamic adjustments to enhance energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements, which introduces conflicting interests between these entities. In this paper, we investigate the sociality regime of UEs and their clusters of APs, characterizing their intra-team cooperation as either selfish, egalitarian, or altruistic. These sociality regimes are crucial in achieving a balance between QoS and energy efficiency per UE. We address this problem by modeling it as a many-to-many social matching game with externalities, where connections can be established based on the sociality regime of both teams. To solve this, we introduce two novel algorithms based on Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Early Acceptance (EA) matching games. Numerical results show the significant impact of the sociality regime adopted by UEs and their clusters of APs on UE's QoS satisfaction and energy efficiency, with the egalitarian regime adopted by both entities proving the best performance trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although deep learning has achieved strong performance in brain tumor analysis, real-world adoption is constrained by computational demands, dataset shift across scanners, and limited interpretability. This paper presents a prototype virtual biopsy pipeline for four-class classification of 2D brain MRI images using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) and complementary radiomics-style handcrafted features. A MobileNetV2-based CNN is trained for classification, while an interpretable radiomics branch extracts eight features capturing lesion shape, intensity statistics, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture descriptors. A late fusion strategy concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features and trains a RandomForest classifier on the fused representation.

A sufficient Lyapunov-based condition is established, guaranteeing convergence before the predefined deadline via divergence of a time-dependent barrier.

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding.

Although active RIS architectures mitigate this issue, they require high power consumption and introduce practical challenges due to the need for integrated amplifiers. Recently, reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surfaces (RDARS) have been proposed to alleviate multiplicative fading through connected modes. In this work, we compare RIS, active RIS, and RDARS in terms of coverage and energy efficiency (EE) in both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, and we investigate the impact of placement and the number of elements of reconfigurable surface (RS) on EE and coverage. The simulation results show that RDARS offers a highly energy-efficient alternative of enhancing coverage in sub-6GHz systems, while active RIS is significantly more energy-efficient in mmWave systems.

These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter.

This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Undergraduate final year project", "summary": "Capsule endoscopy has enabled minimally invasive gastrointestinal imaging, but its clinical utility is limited by the inherently low resolution of captured images due to hardware, power, and transmission constraints. This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis.\n  This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation.\n  Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems equipped with fixed antennas only. We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the WSRs of the proposed schemes are highly dependent on the inter-antenna interference between different user's MAs, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8fd1\u573aMA-\u8d4b\u80fdISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6700\u5c0f\u4f20\u611f\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "MA\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u573a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22MA\u5728\u8fd1\u573aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9BS\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548cZF\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u53d1\u5c04\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u5668\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u63a5\u6536\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\u3001\u7528\u6237MA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548cBS\u53d1\u5c04MA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd1\u573aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528MA\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7b49\u7684WSR\u66f4\u5927\uff0cZF\u9884\u7f16\u7801WSR\u5728\u5404\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6052\u5b9a\uff1bWSR\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u95f4MA\u7684\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u6700\u5c0fSINR\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MA\u5728\u8fd1\u573aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u611f\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u9879\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd1\u573aMA-ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

HOMER pro 3.11.2 was used to design and evaluate a novel, integrated optimization and comparative assessment of diverse HRES, specif ically adjusted to the energy consumptions and available resources of the Hospital. The scenario evaluation showed that interconnecting photovoltaic (PV), biomass generator (BG), wind power (WP), diesel generator (DG), battery, and converter can effectively provide the Hospital's daily energy consumption of 11,214.66 kWh while conforming reliability and reducing emissions. The PV/BG/batt/conv configuration emerged as the most cost-effective and sustainable alternative, attaining the lowest LCOE of \\$0.339/kWh, an NPC of \\$25.7 million, and a 100% renewable energy fraction with simple pay back of 7.26 yr. As a result, the operational cost associated with the consumption of 500.00 L of diesel per month can be entirely avoided. The DG-integrated hybrids exhibit advanced techno-economic capability with significant worth, strong ROI (20\\%) and IRR (18\\%), endorsed by fast capital recovery (7.21-8.71 years).

Traditional security techniques like steganography and encryption are challenging to apply since they are not inherently robust against semantic-level transformations and abstractions. Moreover, the temporal continuity of video enables framewise statistical modeling over extended periods, which increases the risk of exposing distributional anomalies and reconstructing hidden content. To address these challenges, we propose SemCovert, a deep semantic-level hiding framework for secure and covert video transmission. SemCovert introduces a pair of co-designed models, namely the semantic hiding model and the secret semantic extractor, which are seamlessly integrated into the semantic communication pipeline. This design enables authorized receivers to reliably recover hidden information, while keeping it imperceptible to regular users. To further improve resistance to analysis, we introduce a randomized semantic hiding strategy, which breaks the determinism of embedding and introduces unpredictable distribution patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that SemCovert effectively mitigates potential eavesdropping and detection risks while reliably concealing secret videos during transmission. Meanwhile, video quality suffers only minor degradation, preserving transmission fidelity. These results confirm SemCovert's effectiveness in enabling secure and covert transmission without compromising semantic communication performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemCovert\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u9690\u85cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u853d\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6280\u672f\u5982\u9690\u5199\u672f\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4f7f\u5e27\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u6613\u66b4\u9732\u9690\u85cf\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemCovert\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5171\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9690\u85cf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u79d8\u5bc6\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u9690\u85cf\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u5d4c\u5165\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSemCovert\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u9690\u85cf\u79d8\u5bc6\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u8f93\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCovert\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u853d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Contents may change at any time without notice", "summary": "Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u548cHDM-LLM\u76846G RAN\u5207\u7247\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684RAN\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u548cSLA\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5207\u7247\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56Mamba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\uff0cLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u76ee\u6807\uff0cHDM\u534f\u8c03\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u3001\u5207\u7247\u5185\u548c\u81ea\u6108\u667a\u80fd\u4f53", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4transformer\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u8fb9\u7f18\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Agentic AI\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a6G RAN\u5207\u7247\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

It is well known that the capacity-achieving input distribution for this channel is discrete and supported on finitely many points. The best known bounds show that the support size of the capacity-achieving distribution is lower-bounded by a term of order $A$ and upper-bounded by a term of order $A^2$, where $A$ denotes the amplitude constraint. It was conjectured in [1] that the linear scaling is optimal. In this work, we establish a new lower bound of order $A\\sqrt{\\log A}$, improving the known bound and ruling out the conjectured linear scaling.\n  To obtain this result, we quantify the fact that the capacity-achieving output distribution is close to the uniform distribution in the interior of the amplitude constraint. Next, we introduce a wrapping operation that maps the problem to a compact domain and develop a theory of best approximation of the uniform distribution by finite Gaussian mixtures.

To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy.

Existing methods often rely on post-hoc recoloring procedures and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attribute bitstreams in inference, which hinders end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose MEGA-PCC, a fully end-to-end, learning-based framework featuring two specialized models for joint compression. The main compression model employs a shared encoder that encodes both geometry and attribute information into a unified latent representation, followed by dual decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and then attributes. Complementing this, the Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) enhances entropy coding by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations to improve probability estimation. Both models are built on the Mamba architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies and rich contextual features.

A novel iterative code-aided channel estimation (ICCE) technique is developed that uses low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and iterative processing to enhance estimation accuracy while reducing pilot overhead. The core idea is to exploit encoded pilots (EP), enabling the use of both pilot and parity bits to iteratively refine channel estimates. To further improve performance, an iterative channel tracking (ICT) method is proposed that takes advantage of the temporal correlation of the channel. An analytical evaluation of the proposed estimator is provided in terms of normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), along with a study of its computational complexity and the impact of the code rate. Numerical results validate the performance of the proposed scheme in a sub-6 GHz multi-RIS scenario with non-sparse propagation, under both LOS and NLOS conditions, and different RIS architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u591a\u7528\u6237\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u591aRIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801 (ICEDD) \u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528LDPC\u7801\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fe1\u9053\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u975e\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e RIS \u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ICEDD \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fed\u4ee3\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1 (ICCE) \u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fe1\u9053\u8ddf\u8e2a (ICT)\u3002ICCE \u5229\u7528 LDPC \u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u6821\u9a8c\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1bICT \u5219\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u65f6\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6301\u7eed\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ca\u7801\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728 sub-6 GHz \u591a RIS\u3001\u975e\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u64ad\uff08LOS/NLOS\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 ICEDD \u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a RIS \u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u591a\u7528\u6237 MIMO \u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Thus, it is crucial to protect exogenous inputs against full eavesdropping while achieving distributed fusion estimation. To address this issue, a noise injection strategy is provided by injecting mutually independent noises into the local estimates transmitted to the fusion center. To determine the covariance matrices of the injected noises, a constrained minimization problem is constructed by minimizing the sum of mean square errors of the local estimates while ensuring (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differential privacy. Suffering from the non-convexity of the minimization problem, an approach of relaxation is proposed, which efficiently solves the minimization problem without sacrificing differential privacy level.

ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments.

Conventional satellite acquisition typically relies on time-domain beam sweeping, which incurs substantial overhead and latency. In this correspondence, we propose an efficient one-shot satellite acquisition framework that capitalizes on two phenomena traditionally regarded as impairments: i) Doppler effects and ii) beam-squint effects. Specifically, we derive a closed-form \\emph{rainbow beamformer} that leverages beam-squint effects to align frequency-dependent beam directions with satellite positions inferred from their Doppler shifts. This approach enables reception from multiple satellites at once without requiring beam sweeping. To extract satellite position information, we develop three Doppler-aware angle estimation algorithms based on received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional beam sweeping approaches in both acquisition accuracy and required time slots. These gains stem from the ability of the proposed rainbow BF to exploit the \\emph{angle-dependent nature of Doppler shifts}, enabling full angular-domain coverage with a single pilot transmission and reception.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75).

Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images.

However, the reconstruction of CCs face problems of severe artifacts and deformation due to the fundamental reconstruction principle of back-projection of Compton cones. Besides, a part of systematic errors originated from the performance of devices are hard to remove through calibration, leading to deterioration of imaging quality. Iterative algorithms and deep-learning based methods have been widely used to improve reconstruction. But most of them are optimization based on the results of back-projection. Therefore, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework, SwinCCIR, for CC imaging. Through adopting swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module, we established the relationship between the list-mode events and the radioactive source distribution. SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical dataset.

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.\n  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple \"Add and LayerNorm\" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accepted by ACM for presentation at UCC '25 (18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing), December 1-4, 2025, France. Proceedings publication pending", "summary": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners.

The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001).

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709AGIQA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u805a\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u591a\u7b49\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5e38\u5448\u591a\u5cf0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u90fd\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\"\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u53d7\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684GRM\u7ea7\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5206\u652f\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u4f30\u8ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAGIQA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u8d28\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e2d\u7ea7\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b(GRM)\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u5206\u652f\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u4f30\u8ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u5355\u5cf0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5AGQG\u6a21\u5757\u5177\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "AGQG\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AGIQA\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u5c4f\u5e55\u5185\u5bb9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765IQA\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u672fGRM\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u4e3aAGIQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

The paper first reviews the paradigmatic evolution from traditional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to AI-assisted EDA (AI4EDA), and finally to the emerging AI-Native and Agentic design paradigms. We detail the application of these paradigms across the digital chip design flow, including the construction of agentic cognitive architectures based on multimodal foundation models, frontend RTL code generation and intelligent verification, and backend physical design featuring algorithmic innovations and tool orchestration. We validate these methodologies through integrated case studies, demonstrating practical viability from microarchitecture definition to GDSII. Special emphasis is placed on the potential for cross-stage feedback loops where agents utilize backend PPA metrics to autonomously refine frontend logic.

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension.

This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance.

Existing CKM construction methods focus on quasi-static propagation environment. This paper develops a dynamic CKM construction method for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We establish a dynamic channel model that captures the coexistence of quasi-static and dynamic scatterers, as well as the impacts of antenna rotation and synchronization errors. Based on this model, we formulate the problem of dynamic CKM construction within a Bayesian inference framework and design a two-stage approximate Bayesian inference algorithm. In stage I, a high-performance algorithm is developed to jointly infer quasi-static channel parameters and calibrate synchronization errors from historical measurements. In stage II, by leveraging the quasi-static parameters as informative priors, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to estimate dynamic parameters from limited real-time measurements.

Unlike conventional monitoring schemes, the proposed approach is capable of identifying unobservable events that remain hidden from standard sensing infrastructures, such as undetected protection system malfunctions. The framework operates by analyzing deviations in system outputs and behaviors, which are then categorized into three groups: physical, control, and measurement contingencies based on their impact on the SHS model. The SHS model integrates both system dynamics and observer-driven state estimation error dynamics. Within this architecture, machine learning classifiers are employed to achieve rapid and accurate categorization of contingencies. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus systems, where results indicate substantial improvements in both detection speed and accuracy compared with existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5076\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e38\u89c4\u76d1\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6545\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u7b49\u9690\u853d\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u968f\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5076\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 5\u603b\u7ebf\u548c30\u603b\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u968f\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5076\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5e38\u89c4\u76d1\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6545\u969c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic \"upsample-and-add\" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the \"artifacts\" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faKAN\u589e\u5f3a\u7684FPN-Stem\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528KAN\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u66ff\u6362FPN\u672b\u7aef\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ViTPose\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "ViT\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edfpatch\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u524d\u7aef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5355\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931", "method": "\u4fdd\u7559FPN\u7684'\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837-\u878d\u5408'\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u7528KAN\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u6700\u540e\u76843x3\u7ebf\u6027\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u6821\u6b63\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71", "result": "\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cKAN-FPN-Stem\u76f8\u6bd4ViTPose-S\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.0 AP", "conclusion": "ViT\u524d\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5f81\u7ec6\u5316\uff0cKAN\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84"}}

However, cost optimality is fragile, as real-world implementation depends on regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints that are difficult to represent in optimization models and can render cost-optimal designs infeasible. To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

When $\u03c0_{\\text{roll}} \\ne \u03c0_\u03b8$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments.

Nonlinear games are solved via nonlinear least-squares formulations, relying on JAX for automatic differentiation. Linear-quadratic GNEs are reformulated as mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of multiple equilibria. The framework also supports inverse-game and Stackelberg game-design problems.

However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Mob}ility (\\textbf{M}$^3$\\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality.

This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-\u03a3. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning.

Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\\{A, B, Tie\\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \\log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS.

We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning.

The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness.

However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \\textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \\textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \\textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \\textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \\textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \\textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning.

The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores.

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements.

Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions.

We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeMoGen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fd0\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u590d\u7528\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6620\u5c04\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2) \u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u89e3\uff1b3) \u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u91cd\u7ec4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u591a\u6837\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "DeMoGen\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\uff08EI\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cfAI\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u591f\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u54ea\u4e9b\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9AI\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u591f\u5168\u9762\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6db5\u76d6AI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdbAI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u57fa\u4e8e\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency.

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20.

In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCEval\u662f\u5229\u7528\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u8054\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5177\u5907\u57fa\u7840\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d89\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5177\u6709\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u683c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u751f\u6210\u670d\u88c5\u70ed\u963b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ASHRAE\u5168\u7403\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u9650\u4f46\u57281 PMV\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff1bLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684PMV\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u660e\u663e\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "TCEval\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u6709\u6548AI\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5177\u5907\u57fa\u7840\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u53d8\u91cf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u7b51\u7b49\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The system leverages on-device semantic segmentation, LiDAR-based depth estimation, and fused GPS/IMU data to detect and localize sidewalk-relevant features such as traffic signs, traffic lights and poles. To ensure transparency and improve data quality, iOSPointMapper incorporates a user-guided annotation interface for validating system outputs before submission.

In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan.

Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \\gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\\% \\text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\\% \\text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps).

To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning.

We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization.

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization.

A Computationally-Embedded Perspective on the Big World Hypothesis", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)", "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects.

Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events.

In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters.

However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent.

However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility.

Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS.

Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping.

Assaad"], "title": "Regret-Based Federated Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions", "comment": null, "summary": "Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\\mathbf\u03a6$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\\mathbf\u03a6$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "I-PERI\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u533b\u9662\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u6216\u534f\u8bae\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ea7\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faI-PERI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6784\u6210\u7684CPDAG\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5b9a\u5411\u66f4\u591a\u8fb9\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\uff08\u03a6-Markov\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u03a6-CPDAG\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86I-PERI\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "I-PERI\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ea7\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f"}}

Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fr\u00e9chet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.", "AI": {"tldr": "PGR$^2$M\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u76843D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u65f6\u53d8\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982CoMo\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u5e27\u8868\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u59ff\u52bf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec6\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff08PGR$^2$M\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u59ff\u52bf\u5f15\u5bfcRVQ\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5168\u5c40\u7c97\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u53d8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5deedropout\u9632\u6b62\u5bf9\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7840Transformer\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316Transformer\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanML3D\u548cKIT-ML\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4CoMo\u53ca\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5206\u8bcd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cPGR$^2$M\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u6539\u5584\u4e86Fr\u00e9chet\u8d77\u59cb\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "PGR$^2$M\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u76843D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u65f6\u53d8\u7ec6\u8282\u3002"}}

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%.

However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts.

A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow.

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Tan", "Kazushi Ikeda"], "title": "Towards Unsupervised Causal Representation Learning via Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoders", "comment": null, "summary": "Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective.

Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}", "summary": "\\noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome.

Code available at: https://github.com/Rajeeb321123/Latent_sculpting_using_two_stage_method", "summary": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on \"Infiltration\" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\"\u6cdb\u5316\u5d29\u6e83\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Latent Sculpting\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5148\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7c07\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff08\u6cdb\u5316\u5d29\u6e83\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u9896\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5851\u9020\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLatent Sculpting\u53cc\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u54081D-CNN\u548cTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u8d28\u5fc3\u7d27\u51d1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u826f\u6027\u6d41\u91cf\"\u96d5\u523b\"\u6210\u4f4e\u71b5\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u7c07\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u9884\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIC-IDS-2017\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0aF1\u7ea60.30\uff0c\u6700\u5f3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ec50.76\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.87 F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u5728\"\u6e17\u900f\"\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b088.89%\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a0.00%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u6d41\u5f62\u5851\u9020\u662f\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9RLHF\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0IQA\u6a21\u578b\u5168\u5c40\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578bFinPercep-RM\uff08\u542b\u9000\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\uff09\u548c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236CCL\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfIQA\u6a21\u578b\u5728RLHF\u5f15\u5bfcISR\u65f6\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8/\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4ISR\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u4f2a\u5f71\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u865a\u5047\u9ad8\u5206\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684FinPercep-RM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u56fe\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u7ec6\u5fae\u5931\u771f\u7684FGR-30k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCL\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6e10\u8fdb\u589e\u52a0\uff0cISR\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u5f00\u59cb\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6613\u5230\u96be\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RLHF\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709ISR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3RLHF\u5728ISR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies.

While this \"extrinsic maximization\" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer.

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, i.e., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile, are investigated to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data. The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images.

Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions.

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process.

They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation.

However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks.

Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks.

Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecMLP\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u71d5\u9ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u9709\u83cc\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u662fTabPFN\uff0c\u5929\u6c14\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u542b\u6c34\u91cf\u662f\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9709\u83cc\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u8c37\u7269\u4f5c\u7269\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9709\u83cc\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c34\u5e73\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7ecf\u6d4e\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u73af\u5883\u3001\u519c\u827a\u548c\u5730\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u71d5\u9ea6\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u7ebf\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668(MLP)\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MLP\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08TabPFN\u3001TabNet\u3001FT-Transformer\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\uff08RMSE\u3001R\u00b2\uff09\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff08AUC\u3001F1\uff09\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5217\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5TabPFN\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u57fa\u7ebfMLP\u3002\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6536\u83b7\u524d90\u5929\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u79cd\u5b50\u542b\u6c34\u91cf\u662f\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u522b\u662fTabPFN\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u71d5\u9ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u9709\u83cc\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u6536\u83b7\u524d90\u5929\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u542b\u6c34\u91cf\u662f\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content.

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability.

However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions.

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable.

Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding.

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output.

However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\\% and 10\\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively.

Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas.

The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding.

The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle.

Source code available at: https://github.com/Reckonchamp12/physics-constraint-paradox", "summary": "Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent.

However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space.

This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u7403M2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u957f\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cTimeXer-Exog\u6a21\u578b\u572870\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b89%", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u6781\u7aef\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TimeXer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5168\u740318\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684M2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ede\u540e12\u5468\u7684\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efaTimeXer-Exog\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eLSTM\u3001N-BEATS\u3001PatchTST\u53ca\u5355\u53d8\u91cfTimeXer\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83", "result": "\u57282020\u5e741\u6708\u81f32025\u5e748\u6708\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u65e5\u4ef7\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cTimeXer-Exog\u6a21\u578b\u572870\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97MSE 1.08e8\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u53d8\u91cfTimeXer\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d85\u8fc789%", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b"}}

Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u6d88\u9664\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6M-ErasureBench\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u53cd\u8f6c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u7b49\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684IRECE\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u53cd\u8f6c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5df2\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaM-ErasureBench\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u767d\u76d2/\u9ed1\u76d2\uff09\u3001\u53cd\u8f6c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u767d\u76d2/\u9ed1\u76d2\uff09\u4e94\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6d88\u9664\u6548\u679c\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faIRECE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u53cd\u8f6c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5931\u8d25\u4e25\u91cd\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u518d\u73b0\u7387CRR\u8d85\u8fc790%\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\uff1bIRECE\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u6311\u6218\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u53cd\u8f6c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c06CRR\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "M-ErasureBench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6982\u5ff5\u6d88\u9664\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IRECE\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bJavisGPT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668-LLM-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SyncFusion\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u540c\u6b65\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-LLM-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542bSyncFusion\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2\u6865\u63a5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684JAV-DiT\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b20\u4e07GPT-4o\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684JavisInst-Omni\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cJavisGPT\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u540c\u6b65\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "JavisGPT\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ColaVLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5e76\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLM\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7b49\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89e3\u7801\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b3\uff09\u4f4e\u6548\u6216\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301VLM\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faColaVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08Cognitive Latent Reasoner\uff09\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4ec5\u4e24\u6b21VLM\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u3001\u9762\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u5e76\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08Hierarchical Parallel Planner\uff09\u2014\u2014\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cColaVLA\u5728\u5f00\u73af\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ColaVLA\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06VLM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLM\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does.

Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $\u03bc$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem.

Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference.

In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images.

We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.\n  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.\n  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition.

However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text \"in the left lower lung\", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10).

In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with \\mbox{$10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}$} bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.\n  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query--key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \\emph{frame--precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.\n  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures.

In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts.

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%.

Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also \"help in the wrong way\" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.\n  To address this critical \"safety gap,\" we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.\n  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53d8\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56db\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u6821\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u90e8\u7f72\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u9000\u5316\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53d8\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u56db\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6821\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cCRC\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "CRC\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u9000\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information.

In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results.

We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context.

Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift.

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($\u03bc$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $\u03bc$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum.

Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment.

Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering.

In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods.

In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.\n  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.\n  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups.

We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff08MoR\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9FP8\u548cBF16\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.38%\u7684FP8\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u5f20\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff08MoR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6bcf\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u5b50\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9FP8\u548cBF16\u8868\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5212\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u523098.38%\u7684FP8\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5982NVFP4\u7b49\u66f4\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7279\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster.

Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification.

Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios.

Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \\emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models.

Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries.

Inspired by bounded rationality theory and developmental learning, we introduce Sat-EnQ, a two-phase framework that first learns to be ``good enough'' before optimizing aggressively. In Phase 1, we train an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective that limits early value growth using a dynamic baseline, producing diverse, low-variance estimates while avoiding catastrophic overestimation. In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative.

Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated.

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance.

By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation.

However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis.

Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.\n  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.\n  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval.

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail.

Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViLaCD-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u63a9\u819c\uff0c\u518d\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u819c\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u53d8\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u7c97\u53d8\u5316\u63a9\u819c\uff1b2\uff09\u63a9\u819c\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7c97\u63a9\u819c\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u53d8\u5316\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cViLaCD-R1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "ViLaCD-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u65b0\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u62a5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5361\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\u4e14\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u771f\u6b63\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba8\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6743\u8861\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8f85\u52a9\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5361\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u73b0\u6709\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u9884\u62a5\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u7b49\u539f\u5219\u6bd4\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5c42\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u62a5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5361\u662f\u671d\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4fe1\u606f\u611f\u77e5\u76842D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91c7\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContour Information-Aware 2DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5272\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u6805\u5316\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u8fb9\u754c\u6df7\u5408\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u70ed\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8272\u5361\u548cDAVIS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u73b0\u67092DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8fb9\u7f18\u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5206\u5272\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e862D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Uniform Convergence Bounds for Generative & Vision-Language Models under Low-Dimensional Structure", "comment": "13 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings.

Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$\u03b1$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan.

Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies.

In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks.

This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale.

This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically.

Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains.

However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment.

A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL.

By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks.

Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal.

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aFMTC\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u8d28\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u8d28\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b2) \u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eADMM\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFMTC\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FMTC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u805a\u7c7b\u3002"}}

Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches.

This limitation effectively overlooks \"Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the \"train once, deploy many\" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies.

Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation.

MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text.

A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets.

This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence.

Multimodal Complexity Is Not All You Need", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling.

In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability.

We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model.

To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning.

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology.

Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone.

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\u03b4(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization.

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bLiveTalk\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u53caon-policy\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728HDTF\u3001AVSpeech\u3001CelebV-HQ\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53caAnchor-Heavy Identity Sinks\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u5efaLiveTalk\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e20\u500d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5339\u914d\u5b8c\u6574\u6b65\u9aa4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cLiveTalk\u5728\u81ea\u5236\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSora2\u3001Veo3\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece1-2\u5206\u949f\u964d\u81f3\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cLiveTalk\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Enhancing Visual Perception in Vision-Language Models", "comment": "Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models.

However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u67b6\u6784SE-MLP\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u4fb5\u5f7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fb5\u5f7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSE-MLP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9010\u5c42\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u4fb5\u5f7b\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "SE-MLP\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u3001XGBoost\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5c04\u7a0b\u6062\u590d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u5cf0\u503c\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bb9\u8bb8\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u4fb5\u5f7b\u5f15\u4fe1\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models.

Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.\n  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%.

Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning.

IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIntrinsic Decomposition Transformer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u9988\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u672c\u5f81\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7740\u8272\u548c\u955c\u9762\u7740\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u6df7\u5408\u4e86\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5149\u7167\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u5e45\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u660e\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7740\u8272\u548c\u955c\u9762\u7740\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7740\u8272\u3001\u66f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u955c\u9762\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IDT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u672c\u5f81\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TransPhy3D\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u56e0\u6298\u5c04\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u3001ToF\u3001\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7a7a\u6d1e\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u903c\u771f\u900f\u660e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5176\u5df2\u5185\u5316\u5149\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaTransPhy3D\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0811k\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Blender/Cycles\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3RGB+\u6df1\u5ea6+\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6/\u6cd5\u7ebf\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u3002\u5728DiT\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u4e32\u8054RGB\u548c\uff08\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728TransPhy3D\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u5e27\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u5f97\u6a21\u578bDKT\u5728\u5305\u542b\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\uff08ClearPose\u3001DREDS\u3001TransPhy3D-Test\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u3002\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6293\u53d6\u6808\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u7d27\u51d1\u7248\uff081.3B\uff09\u7ea60.17\u79d2/\u5e27\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u61c2\u5f97\u900f\u660e\u6027\u2019\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u6027\u89c6\u9891\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\u03a9(d^\u03c9)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\u03c9\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\u03b5$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient.

Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684Conformal Prediction\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4f20\u7edfSPC\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faConformal-Enhanced\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e38\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408Conformal Prediction\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1Conformal-Enhanced\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\uff08\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u548cConformal-Enhanced\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\uff08\u5c06\u591a\u5143\u63a7\u5236\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6b63\u5f0f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408Conformal Prediction\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSPC\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.\n  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance.

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9690\u542b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u597d\u7684AI\u79d1\u7814\u52a9\u624b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u526f\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u521b\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff08225\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u572870%\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Qwen3-30B-A3B\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b2. \u4e13\u5bb6\u6279\u51c6\u4e8684%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff1b3. \u6269\u5c55\u5230\u533b\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u548carXiv\u9884\u5370\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8612-22%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u901a\u7528AI\u79d1\u7814\u52a9\u624b\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u540c\u6837\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}
